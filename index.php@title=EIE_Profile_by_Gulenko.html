The EIE believes in authority and respects the principle of "leaderism". Emphasizes the uniqueness of the idea with which he is obsessed in the moment. Another feature of behavior common to many EIEs is that they cannot work side-by-side with someone in front of others. They would rather give others all sorts of assignments and orders to send them to another place. EIE manners, especially in an <a href="index.php@title=EIE_subtypes.html" title="EIE subtypes">intuitive subtype</a>, can be very idiosyncratic and distinctive in terms of their accordance with the current norms.

The EIE is oriented at exclusively polite, appropriate, and correct interaction, without elements of coarseness, crudeness, and prodding. He easily takes up the resolution of the most difficult, as it would seem, problems. For example, learning several foreign languages ​​in a short period of time. By his behavior the EIE as if demonstrates the conditional nature of the barriers that limit the possibilities of a human being. In this way Georgi Lozanov has devised a method of intensive study of foreign languages ​​in a short period of time. Sometimes shows inclination to mysticism, to unusual, mysterious phenomena, omens, and exotic religions, etc. Likes to isolate him/herself and in solitude reflect on the meaning of life, and the place and role of person within it.

The EIE's figure is often slim, with thin arms and legs. His gait is brisk and fast - its quickness is more expressed with the emotional component. EIEs are very agile and mobile people. At the same time, they have poor coordination in their movements. An impression might arise that they are purposefully showing off. Characteristic of how an EIE holds him/herself in public - is with some majesty, even arrogance. This impression is created at a distance, due to the fact that the EIE hold his head high, looking bit above and beyond the person in conversation. EIE's clothes is often disharmonious. Frequently, their accessories are not matched well. Their jewelry, for example, may not match the general style of their clothing. As a rule, there is one detail that catches the eye that does not harmoniously tie in with their overall look. Though by itself this detail seems to be perfectly normal. Being perceptive of this, people of EIE sociotype are usually picky about their appearance and dislike when it is being evaluated.

</p><p>The leader of this type is better at solving strategic problems, because he excels at taking the global view of the situation into account. Particularly acutely perceives events that threaten to disrupt the normal rhythm of work and plans. In such cases mobilizes his own forces and capabilities. This is reflected not in concrete actions to address the problems, but in calls to rectify the situation with him pointing out failures in work of those who can resolve the problem. His delivery in this case is very emotional seeking a positive emotional response.
</p><p>Depending on the situation can fill the roles of the frontal leader as well as a hierarchical leader. In the first case will make others follow with innovative ideas. In the second will seek to subjugate the entire organizational to the achievement of the goal. May show a tendency for strong-willed, tough methods and apply direct pressure to subordinates to restore and enforce order, but often prefers to do this "by proxy", for example, using another subordinate to carry out the enforcement. In all cases supports a hierarchically organized structure of the group. Subconsciously subordinates his own interests to the needs of the group, which fosters positive psychological climate. This also helps the group to mature and achieve common goals to see their leader so committed.
</p><p>Uses a variety of methods to influence subordinates and staff in general. The most appropriate method for it - a positive incitement that can be expressed in a smile, a comment or positive evaluation. In the subordinate this evokes a feeling of comfort and activation of his personal energy. However, if required this sociotype can resort to harsh treatment.

Himself has respect for his superiors and requires the same from his subordinates.
</p><p>When establishing business contacts focuses on the personal factor. Has a good feel for people, their mood and emotional orientation.

<ul><li> Prone to solving strategic problems.
</li><li> Able to function as frontal or hierarchical leader.
</li><li> Establishes business contracts focusing on personal factors.
</li><li> Business activity focused on foresight and seeing potential perspectives.
</li><li> Achieves main results by the way of inspiring and emotionally motivating other people.

</li></ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Working_conditions"> Working conditions </span></h2>
<p>Prefers to have creative freedom, eagerly demonstrates own abilities. Mentor is driven by desire for uniqueness. Best performs at jobs that he likes that allows for creative self-realization and can use his inspirer tendencies. This job should also fulfill his requirements for personal growth and self-improvement. So often send Mentor to all sorts of seminars, workshops, and conferences. He likes to perfect himself and also does a good job delivering reports. Mentor loves order and discipline in everything, but it is difficult for him to see to this personally. Try to be punctual, correct and disciplined in communication with him. It will strongly help your relations. He also likes people who can protect his interests, confidently and vigorously defend opinions. Working with the Mentor can be pretty messy: sometimes for a while you will not be able to get any concrete results out of him as he will be dramatically depicting for you all the possible difficulties that will arise. He also will try to impose on you his own strategy and his own schedule of work. Do not yield to him in any case: divide the work into small sequential steps, set deadlines and be strict with him about following them through. Ask for reports on completion of each step. This will mobilize the Mentor and make his work more organized, because it will make him feel the responsibility.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Recommendations_for_self-improvement"> Recommendations for self-improvement </span></h2>
<p>The most developed side of your personality is the ability to experience intense emotions. You are the person with a complicated spiritual world, full of contrasts and contradictions. For the sake of true, deep feelings you can sacrifice quite a lot.
</p><p>You have an inherent poetic nature that you can express in metaphorical form, often dramatic, sometimes tragic-comic. You may have talent of an orator, who knows how to use speech to ignite many people.
</p><p>You can be said to be a visionary, a man of great foresight. You have a good feeling for crises ripening within developing situations and can take measures beforehand to avoid them. You seek to warn others about the possible troubles that threaten them. This is the expression of the humanitarian focus of your personality. You are a rather principled person and do not forgive insults and humiliations. To achieve this, you, weighing all pros and cons, are able to take the most drastic measures. However, in some cases, your principles can be inflexible and your decisiveness can be excessive. Aim to exercise restraint in emergency situations, try to make decisions in a calm state.
</p><p>Your main problem - the inability to avoid situations which bring you misery and discomfort. You do not always fit easily into the society and avoid unpleasant contact with uninteresting people. You show lack of confidence and certainly in your tastes, inability to properly track your own well-being.
</p><p>The inability to find an inner balance with yourself is characteristic of you. Avoid over-dramatization of the events. Discharge the accumulated emotions in creative self-expression: singing, playing musical instruments, theater, etc.
</p><p>Do not seek to make an impression at all costs. From this your interests or health will suffer. Dress according to weather, follow some order in nutrition, favor healthy foods. Try to keep your dress style consistent with the situation.
</p><p>Do not be as sensitive to compliments and evaluation of your appearance. Do not immediately assume wrongdoings. Train to work openly and in public to stop painfully perceiving attention to your work. Try to trust people more and avoid thinking that they mean harm to you.
</p><p>Another problem areas - a desire to show yourself as an enterprising, active man, but not demonstrating these skills in action. Do not exaggerate the significance of your initiatives. Always ask yourself realistically how likely is it that you will take action and whether these actions will lead to positive results. Overcome your desires to ignore the daily affairs, including maintenance of your home. Articulate your problems more concretely. Do not be pushy and intrusive with respect to others.
</p><p>Your interaction with people can be difficult also because of the manifestations of excessive formality. Avoid arrogance, be more democratic and straightforward with people. Do not overdo it with irony and ridicule. Your penchant for sarcasm can hurt people and turn them away from you.
