<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="ILE_.28Don_Quixote.29"> ILE (Don Quixote) </span></h2>
<p>People of this type are discerning of latent possibilities of people, things, objects, ideas, developments and discoveries. They are interested in everything new and unexpected, and generate a lot of ideas. However, it is easier for them to talk of ideas or hypotheses than to implement them into practical development and implementation. They realize this themselves, thus do not hesitate to ask others for help. As a rule, they have a very large circle of acquaintances. 
</p><p>The range of their curiosity is very broad. They tend to read a lot and on different topics. Due to their intuitive submergence, they are quite scattered - may forget things, not to notice a friend, or pass by their stop on public transport. His thoughts and ideas ILE tries to articulate logically, sometimes developing rather sophisticated and interesting theories, which he may use for minor everyday activities as well as for serious research. In this way, for example, Galileo Galilei discovered by logical methods the law of falling bodies, and what we call the principle of Galilean relativity; Karl Marx created the theory of economic relations; Albert Einstein - Theory of Relativity, and Sigmund Freud - his famous theory of psychoanalysis.
</p><p>Typically, ILE looks calm and relaxed, but in extreme situations becomes mobilized, showing considerable willpower and determination. If he is being threatened, he can deliver a sharp rebuff, which is often surprising to people around him. If he's playing on a team, by shouts and orders he can mobilize his teammates. Dislikes clarifying and sorting out relationships and conversations on this topic - this irritates him. At times, in the name of reason, tends to ignore the moral demands of society - as Sigmund Freud published his research on sexuality despite the opinion of the public, which has turned away from him.

And he found Troy because passionately believed in it. I must say that the humanities disciplines, such as linguistics, in "Hugo" exceptional ability. Engels knew about a dozen European languages.
