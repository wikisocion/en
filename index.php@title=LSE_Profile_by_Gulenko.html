<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="As_a_supervisor"> As a supervisor </span></h2>
<p>A supervisor of this type likes order and firmly asserts his positions in life. Hardworking, demanding of himself and others. For such people frequently their work is the passion of their life, to which he devotes a lot of his time and energy.
</p><p>Supervisor-organizer <br />
A good organizer has qualities of practical business orientation. He can follow through with a previously adapted course of action, remove any obstacles along the way, and get other people involved in active and creative work.
</p><p>As a leader, the LSE often puts forward new proposals concerning rational use of material and intellectual resources. Very active in giving assignments, instructions, and supervision of work process. Gives priority to communication. Spends a lot of effort getting acquainted with people and developing contacts with those around him. In work, focuses on past experience that led to a positive outcome.
</p><p>Inclined to resolve tactical problems. This is explained by particularity of his thinking style, which is aimed at calculating the logic of facts, events, and actions. Out of entire flow of information he distinguishes that which may be useful for the planned work or project, and discards the rest as having no bearing to the matter at hand. Such mental attitude allows the LSE to rationally manage and organize materials and intellectual resources available within the system (e.g. his working group, company, or household). The LSE builds plans for gradual, evolutionary development of this system, rationalizing and improving some of its parts. Has an inclination to stick to traditional values, which includes professional ethics and personal etiquette. With the above mentioned qualities, representatives of this sociotype often achieve major success within stable structures and organizations, but experience many difficulties if they have to manage complex, unpredictably changing organizational systems.

</p><p>LSE's exacting and demanding attitude towards his subordinates is combined for him with the desire to create the most comfortable conditions for work, and to remove external hindrances and obstacles for more effective operations. Only when he achieves this, he believes that he has the right to make demands, which favorably distinguishes him from other sociotypes, such as SLE and LSI, which tend to show little interest in working conditions of their subordinates.
</p><p>The LSE copes better with functions of a hierarchical leader. A manager of this type is usually conservative by nature, dislikes taking risks, and adheres to established ways of operation. Tries to reach new goals by tried-and-tested methods, using old contacts and ties. Negatively perceives any criticism directed at him concerning this matter.
</p><p>The LSE bases his interactions with other people and business partners on basis of code of honor and rules of fair play. An opponent of trickery, lies, duplicity. His own integrity is founded on logical principles. In interpersonal relationships he is characterized by keeping a certain emotional distance; does not seek to come in close contact with many other people. In a system of formal ties, the LSE is characterized by smooth manner of communication. Despite this, he gravitates towards being able to influence other people, to direct their thoughts and their actions. Tries to be in the midst of events, to have a wide circle of contacts who bring to him diverse information. Gravitates towards cooperation. Tries to discuss and align his interests with those of his partner. Nevertheless, finds it difficult to reach an acceptable compromise.
</p><p>On every issue or topic the LSE has his own opinion. He's ready to argue on any subject, even if he isn't fully proficient and competent in it. During such discussions, he can get excited, hot-tempered, and stubbornly prove his rightness. Inclined to exaggerate negative consequences or miscalculations of any project or event. Values ​​his reputation. It is on basis of this that it's possible to strike a compromise with representative of this sociotype.
</p><p>The "Administrator" by his set of psychological qualities is able to act as in role of leader-organizer. He is able to understand what constitutes the common interests of people with whom he works; capable of understanding the difficulties (problems) of individuals as well. The LSE has a developed ability to understand and articulate the common interests of the collective. And he is ready to defend those interests. May speak up for a person if he's being treated unfairly. Can engage other people in a discussion of shared problems in the team, put forward proposals on how to meet the needs of the employees. Raises questions about the needs of his collective (team, work-group) before his superiors, not waiting for orders from "above". Can sense what people prefer to not speak about, as well as grasp and express the shared opinion of the individuals of the group or collective on any significant to them topics. The LSE is ready to sacrifice his personal interests for the interests of the collective. He is persistent in defending the interests of his employees. Due to this characteristics, he may, irrespective of his position, take over the functions of the representative of a work-group or a team.
</p><p>Main characteristics:
</p>
<ul><li> Great at resolving tactical problems.
</li><li> Objectively oriented leader within a hierarchically organized system.
</li><li> In establishing contacts focuses on objective factors.
</li><li> Business activity is aimed at removing barriers and discomfort in productive activities of his subordinates.
</li><li> His system of interaction with his subordinates presupposes active management and control and issue of assignments or orders.
</li><li> Characterized by collaborating type of behavior with elements of competing style.
</li><li> He values  the results of production more than the established relations.
</li><li> In regard to ethical standards, he believes that management decisions should be based on clear set of laws and accepted "rules of the game".
</li><li> Motives and purpose: good intentions, however, doesn't fully consider the impact of his decisions on other people. His goal is profit.
</li><li> Strategy: full freedom to manage and control within the framework of the law.
</li></ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Working_conditions"> Working conditions </span></h2>
<p>The stimulus that moves the LSE to work is the possibility of achieving high administrative or managerial status in a group. In short, he strives to direct and manage all affairs in his own way, and likes for his opinions to be taken into consideration. Of course, it would be easiest to appoint him to such a position - then you won't have problems neither with his team or department, nor with the LSE himself. Because if he is only a regular member of the team, and his managerial abilities don't find an application and appreciation, he will still try to intrude into your management affairs, even if this work isn't fully within his field of competence: he will tell you what to do, how it's best to proceed, and voice his criticisms of wrong actions. 
</p><p>From aside, it may seem that such a practical type of personality as an LSE should not have any problems in life. However, despite his organization, efficiency and rationality, the "Administrator" rarely feels happy and satisfied. He finds it difficult to keep inner soulful balance and maintain an optimistic outlook on life. He cannot relax and rest because he is constantly preoccupied with current affairs and worries about tomorrow. He feels constantly dissatisfied by people close to him, because they almost never have such level of integrity and responsibility in affairs as LSE would have liked to see from them. It can be said that the LSE is prevented from being happy by a "complex of eternal achiever", who seeks to obtain only the highest evaluations in life. Thus, the only thing that can ease his burden of "working for entire socion" is simple, soulful participation, calmly listening to his worries and concerns, and showing sympathy. Since this sociotype - is a linear-assertive type, it is pointless to try to convince him otherwise once he's already in agitated, negative state. You have to calmly wait out this storm and allow him to speak his out his heart and his mind. When he starts to calm down, here you can talk to him in a sincere and heartfelt manner, persuade him that not everything is as bad, and this has happened before, but all has ended well, etc. After he fully calms down, you may criticize him a little, explain that he himself was wrong and acted harshly, that not all people are bad and not always. Remind him of specific situations when people of whom he spoke badly demonstrated their competence and behaved themselves impeccably. The "Administrator" needs not only emotional support, but also constant unobtrusive instruction or education, which would precaution him from manifesting harsh attitudes in relation to other people.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Recommendations_for_self-improvement"> Recommendations for self-improvement </span></h2>
<p>Your forte - is your strict logic that is based on concrete facts, which allows you to accurately calculate the practical aspect of any undertaking. You are a sober realist, capable of correctly evaluating the usefulness and effectiveness of any venture.
</p><p>You are usually clever, quick-thinking, and informed in the sphere of your engagement. You are an active and energetic person, who does not like to idly waste time, who knows what you want, and will strive to achieve it through hard work, persistence, and determination. You are able to use your material resources in effective and economical manner.
</p><p>You are also able to create material prosperity and comfort for yourself and your family members. You strive for a healthy, balanced, harmonious life, and don't spare you efforts in order to attain it, as well as stimulate others around you to various useful activities. You possess good organizational skills and know how to create suitable conditions for people to do work, to make them become interested and involved, and only then demand results from them. You highly value quality in work and are intolerant of lack of discipline and laziness.
</p><p>You like beautiful, high quality items, as well as tasty, healthy food. You like it when people evaluate you based on your merits, and don't impinge on your independence in selecting solutions or methods of action.
</p><p>One of your weak points is an inability to plan for alternative events for lengthy periods of time. You often find yourself overloaded with tasks, chores, and work that appear seemingly from nowhere, and require time to prepare for important events. You have difficulty foreseeing approaching danger or failure in business. Unexpected turns of events that you could not foresee frustrate and unnerve you, knock you out of balance. You find it difficult to spend much time waiting for the outcome of any undertaking, especially if there's little confidence in its success. 
</p><p>You are recommended to frequently review your views on various aspects of life, and to put aside any outdated and unworkable traditions and habits. Dry logic of facts should not suppress in you the appreciation of all that is new and unusual. Moderate your conservatism and stubbornness. More often compare yourself to others, cultivate flexibility in your ways of competing.
</p><p>You tend to rely on your intuition in your assessments of people, not suspecting that you greatly overestimate this ability in yourself and that you are not immune from arriving at erroneous conclusions and prognoses. The consequence of this may be inappropriate or mis-attributed suspicions, and undue harshness in dealing with others, which can put you in an awkward ethical position. Try to have more restraint and tact in such questions.
</p><p>Another one of your problems is your inability to control your emotions in relation to people who are close to you, who don't obey your instructions and guidance, if their actions contradict your logic and common sense. This is all the more upsetting to your close ones, that at the same time you behave with restraint, emphasized politeness and good manners towards strangers and unfamiliar people. Your family members and close ones may feel upset and disappointed with you due to such contrasts in your behavior.
</p><p>With you lack of restraint you can alienate your loved ones. Try to be more patient, don't rush to tell the truth to a person's face. Being excessively direct usually does not work in your favor. Cool down first, then think about what is better to say, to whom, and in which manner.
</p><p>Learn to relax, to switch you focus from work to pleasant ways to take a break. Try to look at conflicts from the side of humor. You are usually endowed with a good sense of humor - it can calm you and let you vent your emotions in an acceptable form. 
</p><p>Read fiction more often. Go to the theater - such leisure activities will soften your harsh character and help you to nurture and cultivate refinement and nobility of your sentiments and feelings.
