<p><b>1st function "Good" - objective intuition (Ne). "Oh, what a beautiful and harmonious as the world, especially pipe plants!" </b><br />
Living in harmony and flow capacity of the external world, the integrity of the external situation, "all is well in this best of all possible worlds." Violation of this harmony perceives is always aggressive, say, repair the apartment for him - a reason for the emergence of aggression. Since it can be difficult to negotiate, since he seemed to "veer", going through life, "can be that way, but you can." Therefore, an attempt to clearly define the time with him and the venue can be an exercise in futility, "I'll be there first, then there is, and most likely, if all the time to be able, in the area so much, I'll be there somehow." No perception of space and time as something permanent, which can not be moved, somehow, very roughly, vaguely, for the sake of accuracy of the meeting makes no sense to change the plans, thus destroying the harmony of the external situation. If he is late for work and ask him at the same time bring a bucket, since he is still late, it means to destroy the integrity of the external situation, as it was all "is already taken into account" that the work can sometimes be late, included in the concept of the integrity of the situation, "bucket" there did not appear. Data types People "live" with original ideas about the outside world and are conservative in this knowledge unit, from the impression of "great masters" - no one knows that he came into our heads the next second time. And this love of volatility they erected bounce back conservative behavior for them - a perennial irritant. Those who criticize their ideas, and their annoying, they do not know how to defend them, often surround themselves with those who agree with them. They annoy people who scandals arrange external conflicts, even if it is "in the case." For external conflict - also the destruction of the outer harmony. Often, like something to check out for others, but do not like to start, as it is also sometimes means destruction of external harmony, which for them - a zone of conservatism. The first function of the third: meaning that all of each other in a harmonious world of love, all "good". If it is not, it means a minus from two functions, aimed at himself, then there is a very "bad".
</p><p><b>2nd function "Needed" - subjective logic (Ti). "I learned a lot in my life, but I want to understand more, including what I understand is not right."</b><br />
He likes long, detailed and creatively explain anything other than a teacher, a teacher, "I explain, while I listen while 100% will not be sure that everyone understood everything." Ask him questions - sometimes you can listen to the answer for hours, sometimes just looking for someone to speak out on "their understanding of something" "Wriggle out" of this can be difficult if you do not talk about it straight. Something similar can be the object and the second logic function sometimes, but in this case the emphasis is not on facts, but on the fact that all necessarily all have understood, sometimes explained as children for this reason. This man is constantly looking for an audience with questions, but did not explain in terms of knowledge, but from the point of view of how he understands it, that is more intelligible and meticulously. Loves find a range of applications: something that has not been studied and understood before, sometimes like to begin to explore the unknown for itself a sphere in which they have no qualifications, as this allows us to develop the scope of "understanding" something that is very tempting for the creative function. The second function of the third: likes to talk a lot about relationships, psychology; on the first and fourth sometimes even how beautiful the world is, on the prospects of a case and where he was physically well and comfortably.
</p><p><b>3rd function "Problems" - objective ethics (Fe). "I wish I win the People's Choice Award!"</b><br />
It is important that all treated him well. He does not like ambiguity in this matter and constantly seeks to clarify the situation: "Let's find out all the same, you respect me or not?". Clarification of this issue could cause any little thing: face, eyes, and so on. Often with age becoming also good psychologists, since it allows you to maintain a good self-esteem. It is fixed on the relation to his particular people and ignores the "public opinion". Very susceptible to social recognition: honor, glory, respect, letters, insignia, etc. For the sake of good relations can sometimes be up to him and to work away for free, to help someone to do something of a sense of camaraderie. If the environment appears someone whose feelings for him negative, it causes a drop in its self-evaluation. With its active protection - it will try to win the good attitude of man at any cost, passively - on the contrary, it can say something like: "I'm here now so bad." If there is a good relationship, you may try to adjust them at any cost, or, conversely, to avoid them in the case of realization of the impossibility to change something. Susceptible to any flattery, often ready to support any opinion, and to compromise, you do not accidentally change the attitude to yourself, and if you do not agree with someone, it is very diplomatic. Speaking to representatives of this type - often feel internal stress associated with fear to cause me to film, so they often think ten times before you say anything. As if to refer to this as a job. Move up the career ladder often at the expense of the ability to be considerate of others.
</p><p><b>4th function "Want" - subjective sensation (Si). "May be I am bad guy, but I have a sandwich with butter."</b><br />
Always moving in the direction of places where there is physical comfort, exquisite sensory pleasure and are not able to deny yourself this. Where it is physically comfortable there and well, even if it is very expensive. Love gourmet food, massage, stroking. Finding one place where they feel comfortable, for example, restaurant some - can go there for dinner across town. Avoid places where there is all of necessary physical facilities. Gourmets around, slaves to their preferences and habits. If you like sweet, then will eat it pounds. Often determine the state of health from the words of others, because it is very suggestible on it. Sometimes it may be trying to recreate elements of the home where they feel as comfortable as physically. Quickly get used "to the good" and this becomes their weakness in the future, without it they can not. Suggestibility authorities with respect to health issues, if to tell him that he has something to be treated, it is easy to believe it can. In this context, it can become easy prey for "paid doctors." They may forget to eat on time, take medications to sleep, so it is in need of a caring parent or spouse.
</p><p><b>- 1 function "Bad" - subjective intuition (Ni).</b><br />
The integrity of the internal situation is the most rigidly ignored socionical value. This means that a person is no such thing as an "inner core", ideology, ideology, matching words and deeds. "Where are tastier" - that ideology and better. He does not know how to dive into yourself, meditate, find inner peace on their own, making the surface becomes a little man. Instead of looking outside harmony. That is, it is necessary to find, create for themselves outer harmonious world, fabulous, and only acquired and inner harmony. In all other cases, it will often idealize the existing world, all the people in it - always "good". This is what it replaces finding inner harmony. If work on the first function an objective can not be realized for some external hindering her reasons, and when it starts to go about matters relating to subjective intuition, sometimes a person can begin to defend themselves through it, to criticize: to accuse someone of conservatism his ideas and principles, to attack someone else's principles, ideas. They do not like, especially when something is done in the name of some great ideas, goals. They think it's some kind of abomination. Do not know how they calm down on their own: it is necessary to be sure to find someone and "Pour out" his soul, use it as a vest. For these purposes, any person can use. As a result, it allows him to somehow maintain inner harmony and sometimes, even though she is in the area most severely repressed values, then again it will be possible to begin to ignore it, focusing only on the outer harmony of the world.
</p><p><b>- 2 the function "Not needed" - objective logic (Te).</b><br />
He does not like the changes in the rules and the laws of the external world. They just have them and he adheres to, even though it is not easy. He taught them and they should only be where it is strictly regulated by the society: rules of the road, coming to work on time, payment of taxes, the penal code and is waiting for the same from others. But to meet with friends can be late and that he does often. The inversion of the situation, which is sometimes still happens if you can not be realized by the second function in the world, begins to criticize the political system existing in the world of laws and regulations, an objective order of things. The result is a more objective assessment of the facts of external reality, and it is, sooner or later, it is a job for the second function.
</p><p><b>- 3 function "Solution to problems" - subjective ethics (Fi).</b><br />
To solve the problem of self-function, you need to all be loved. But to achieve this, and sometimes need to communicate to people that treat them well, they like to. All The problem is that this function is used as a stop-gap of force majeure for the third function. Therefore, if all is well, then work on it people will not be until the real problems. If he gets into the team, where you have to win the respect, yes, and he will try to express their sympathy to him. But if he knows that in his family, in any case, he will be respected, and it can do everything, he pleases, until you start to arise in this place real problems: for example, the threat of the collapse of the family. And the result is a very strong contrast: for "their" people seems "petty tyrant", but the rest of it seems to be "the soul of society." As soon as someone else, the person It becomes a "pious," and when he left - again "concerts", "one-man show." Here a person stores a lot of money to solve the problems of the third function: knows when to smile at the right moment to express my admiration for anything, ask the other person's problems, volunteered to help solve them. But he only uses it to solve their problems: existing and potential, in the anticipation. It is better to be safe once again, and to praise someone, than if he somehow offended. These feelings in this situation are driven underground and can unexpectedly for him to break out, ruining relationships. And often they are pulled out just where "Possible" - that is, among the "friends". That creates a potential threat to "domestic tyranny."
</p><p><b>- 4 function "Don't want to" - object sensation (Se).</b><br />
Dislikes brute physical force. Usually not a specialist skills if something went wrong, then, without hesitation, it is a specialist, even if the question and "damn" is not worth it. It can not bring anything to the end, to finish. It can not tolerate waiting, sacrifice himself for the sake of victory. Their work often very talented, but not "brought to the point", as their author simply lazy. During his appearance usually is not very able to follow dress. If the fourth function may not withdraw from an unfavorable situation for themselves and find a better place, it can be turned on minus four. Sometimes - as soon as there is a potential threat such as this - a good way to prevent the break up of objective and subjective realities. So in a strange, unknown situation or when you can not leave a place for themselves adversely, can sometimes try to appear courageous, decisive, strong-willed person, do not understand why all of a sudden start to deal with the "windmills", suddenly lash out at someone without objective reasons. He has his own understanding, when it is still possible to apply brute force sometimes, but it is very strange and the deviation from this understanding makes him irritated. The real reason for this infrequent phenomenon is simply impossible to leave a place that no longer seems to him physically comfortable. It is possible that the way out of this situation may be a need to learn and the ability to create it in any situation for themselves.
</p><p><b>Summary description:</b><br />
Irrationals, which means inner unpredictability (constancy in unpredictability), windy, and vice versa symptoms very standard: clothing, work, "product". Furthermore, since the first function and is associated with more improbable events, it becomes absolutely unpredictable extreme forms and can be regarded as a negative factor. But the main "product" is also associated with improbable events, thereby becoming a little less than the standard, which in this case can be considered a positive factor. Extraverted type, it means that he sees himself part of the world, not something out of it isolated. To itself it seems clear and simple, so do not hesitate to tell something about themselves. The world around him seems complicated, difficult to understand, so he does not know how to manipulate, distribute commands instead with interest studying it. Dominant needs associated with weak functions. Because of this, it is extremely important for health to have outside support of their actions: to organize physically convenient location, and to win the sympathy of others for self-assessment (3 and 4 function). As the leading features are not associated with the dominant needs, superficially may impress some inhibition action, the lack of vitality in man (the tendency to melancholy temperament - unbalanced, stationary). Note: The recommendation from the health point of view - somewhat lower external activity. Living in the flow of both quantitative and qualitative information, which means the ability to maneuver well in her stream: to know where to go and act effectively.

<b>Key to success:</b> the location of the increased comfort, sympathy for others, a harmonious world, the demand for his explanations and logical reasoning.<br />

<p><b>1 function "Good" - subjective sensation. "I am a friend to his taste."</b><br />
Living sensory pleasures of life and are looking for them everywhere for itself: delicious food, a comfortable chair, a variety of physiological pleasant feeling. Most consider themselves experts in taste, if I love the heat, all who love the cold - walruses. If I love the cold, all who love the heat - Merzlyakov. It is very self-confident in matters of health, may put their opinions about health "above" the opinions of doctors or even treat them lightly. Almost always have good health, but excessive enthusiasm sensory pleasures of life can greatly podkashivat them. Smoking, alcohol, overeating and other gluttony - it is very difficult to refuse from it all. At the same time, in these matters sensory tastes very conservative. When engaged in a kitchen, it usually turns out he is a very good thing if this "is the soul." But someone else "strepnyu" can be very critical, especially risky meals. Often, all you need for comfort issues carry with them. Feel free to talk about intimate matters without considering it necessary to something to hide in this, love to talk about their sores. His sensory conservative, so in these matters, he is very affectionate. I am confident in their invulnerability, reliability, "neproshibaemosti". If it is something "feels", "feel", that one   will not listen, will do everything "in his own way." He loves reliable things that can be "horseshoe bend", and such an idea may come to mind easily. He is fluent in your body, its plasticity. They have always something to feel physically, to confirm their presence in the world, and they surround themselves with such "thing": soft kitty, warm carpet, wool socks, iron balls spinning fingers. Many "fussing" for convenient - it is not convenient, but do not worry, namely "fussing" as a way to maintain a conversation. The first function of the third: meaning that in matters of sensory pleasures, he understands a lot. Both functions are focused on themselves, so the destruction of this principle very strongly his exasperated.  
</p><p><b>2 function "must" - the object of ethics. "Yes, I know how to please people, and even if they do not like someone - I will work on it."</b><br />
Very skillful and subtle manipulator people's feelings, schemer, a psychologist, is able to please and sees this as his destiny. Often, non-communicative like people in need of contact, carries them to "light". Constantly in the process of building an ethical: can promise something a man just for the sake of improving relations with him. Rarely are alone, because wherever there are people, there   it is possible to like them, so it is - the subject of their work, whether he likes it or not,   you need to act, to create "good relationship" with them. He knows how to make yourself advertising, to create the right mood in society, or from anyone, to boast. He likes to find a negative relationship between people and turn them into positive ones, unite the people. But sometimes, when there is no need to change anything on the "personal front" can deliberately spoil them, and then had the opportunity to once again establish all, that is, to find himself in such a way, the work of the second function. He is able to impose their desires another so that they perceived them as their own. Other people's desires are often the subject of their scheming, as they allow to improve the attitude towards it, and this is his vocation in society. He loves risky, spontaneous relationships, "on the verge of a foul." They know how to persuade - they are ideal "vtyuhivateli"   goods and services, if become salespeople. Top "levator sentiment" in the world,   "Splochateli teams." But the constant intrigue often costs them their jobs, because what they are able to seamlessly "white" to pass off as "black" and at the same time to go "unscathed", sooner or later it becomes apparent when it happens regularly. The second function of the third: love to win the goodwill of the people talking on the themes that he really understands the issues of understanding with loved ones. The second of the first and fourth sometimes can also try to gain the sympathy of candid impressions of how it somewhere good time, positive impressions of his stay in the nature,   some festival or stunning   an atmosphere of general "positive" in any place where he was well-located, offering the next time go together.
</p><p><b>3 function "Problems" - subjective logic. "How to find an easy way to understand everything?"</b><br />
It is important to understand everything. Therefore, if you ask him about the difficult things sometimes, you can hear the answer that he understands them (only a very peculiar). It is important that everyone knew him as well. If understanding is impossible, that human self-esteem drops, so it does not like to admit that something is not understood. It is important to praise the consistency, likes to boast that he was up to something thought of himself. Often he loves to refer to some everyday stories, because nobody will not even think to check their authenticity, in general likes to refer to someone as a way to protect their reasoning (since then responsible for objectivity is passed on to them). He loves implemented in areas that do not require the actual confirmation. When the passive protection of self pleads stupid or complains that no one understands, the active will argue that he understands all right. His logic - the logic of common sense, simple worldly savvy, as it is difficult to say something. All burst into his life, must be understood and comprehended. And he, breaking into other people's lives, hopes   to be understood by them. He is afraid to make a mistake in their understanding of something, do not guess, but if anything, can be very   easy to change your explanations, just as the opinion, but so that it is not conspicuous ( "crocodiles fly, but a low-dwarf"). Many are worried and are trying to clarify questions of understanding with others, "you do not understand me, because I wanted to do better." They want to be appreciated for its sincerity.
</p><p><b>4 function of "I want" - the object of intuition. "Oh, you already have a harmonious, perfect world? Giving family, work and go to you!"</b><br />  
Looking for a place to stay where there is no external conflicts, where there is an external harmony, positive atmosphere and avoid places where it is not. According to this principle can and pick up his personal life,   work. It can get involved in unexpected ideas for the structure of the world, inspired bold innovative ideas. He loves nature because it is constant, not changing, always calm and harmonious. It inspires any external harmony and dislikes when it is destroyed. If this happens, just go back to where it is, without trying to change something. Often harmony for it is still there, where he feels the center of some of the situation around him "everything revolves." They love to visit festivals, carnivals, festivals, because they are foreign harmony holiday atmosphere. Usually this type of people absorb the   the atmosphere, the harmony, the situation that prevailed at the time when they were children, and then reproduce in their lives is it really love to remember his childhood as something to which they'd like to come back. Very talented people like bearing outer harmony: the creators of art, musicians, artists, poets, sometimes willing to support them, even financially for the opportunity to be in their company, often dragging them to her house to place as if lit outer harmony. Looking for people who believe that all will be well in the future only, believe in a positive future. He does not like the unpredictability, the chaos of the future situation, someone has to help   him to seek the correct options to catch the desired capabilities, so it is very suggestible and trusting in   matters of decision-making. He likes predictability, to move "from target to target." If this   the sequence is disrupted and unexpected event happens, it may fall into a "stupor", so   usually tries to "podstelit straw", to provide in advance all the options. A good place for him even where there is an external integrity of the landmark general movement, estimated timetable. For example,   I go to college to finish it in 5 years. If it harness to some schedule, schedule, the most out of this would be difficult due to the function Suggestibility. That is instead necessary to give another, more advanced, with a guaranteed "bright future."   
</p><p><b>- 1 function "Poor" - object sensation.</b><br />
They do not like to strain, do not like. It is necessary to make one, second, third, and so want to relax,   have a good time. And often the work is a sacrifice of "spree". Dress is often not very stylish: no whole image, in general appearance they have not "worked out." They can, for example, not to follow the teeth, if they do not hurt. Do not know how to count money and treat them all: not having time to get them,   soon spend, often live in debt. Do not know how to endure, wait to achieve goals achieved. Instead, consider that all this is - evil, and you just need to live happily without attaching any importance to this. Do not attach importance to the actions and deeds of others, as if carried away instead only themselves.   Ignore other people's volitional pressure on myself, something like: "Well, that, and I want to." Usually they are - very stubborn children who will do everything in its own way and "put pressure" on them can be difficult in this respect. With age, this is less, but still present. If the first function may not operate objectively, its actions are under attack, you can begin to defend themselves: climb into the fray, attacking someone. Thus a person clears the field for its future activities. If a situation arises where there is no way to continue to live in his pleasure, then we have to somehow make themselves work, strain, to earn more money for it.
</p><p><b>- 2 the function "Do not" - subjective ethics.</b><br />
His present relation to something not often expressed only in certain situations. And it is not like the other revelations, especially in relation to itself, outside of those same situations. They usually have their opinion if they slip, it is very veiled. In other situations, they say, it's nice to listen, teaches in a favorable light. Even if they want sometimes to criticize someone, the cultural, politely, diplomatically. But in some situations, which is considered acceptable for this purpose,   of course, his words will not climb. That is my real attitude speaks only   when someone strongly "comes on his toes" or when it will not change the attitude to it, there is still at it   can   be some of his rules for such situations, it is dependent on the individual. If you want to express their attitude to something, it does it "banal", as they do in principle.   If a person for a long time could not find a job for the second function, as in this case - a rarity, so   as communication is always there, it can start to criticize others, to express their real attitude to something, usually with a minus sign. Thus, there is an alignment of subjective and objective realities and can again to "create" in the sphere of relations, as they come in the end to the "common denominator."
</p><p><b>- 3 function "Problem Solving" - Object logic.</b><br />
He always handy notebook with phones of all professionals in any field, which may be useful if there are any with the logic of the objective world problems. Also, if something is not clear, it is very helpful is to look in a textbook, encyclopedia, in which all will be written, and it is easier to understand all this. He often carries a handbooks, instructions, but climbs in them, unfortunately, only when problems arise. And while they are not there, he can easily make some mistake. For example, can the car do something wrong just because   that something was not well understood until the beginning of the "act up" something. Sometimes it can work on pre-emption,   "Collect" different ways of solving various potential problems and the objective world   at the right time to share it with someone else, so you do not strain. However, it is difficult to foresee all.
</p><p><b>- 4 function "do not want to, I'm afraid" - subjective intuition.</b><br />  
It does not like to dive, "inward", afraid of this. Even more afraid when someone tries to do it for him. The first thing he would say, "do not climb into the soul." Because of this may seem very   superficial, inconsistent man, devoid of "inner core." Such things as the principles and ideology for him - something too frightening. However, in certain situations, it may consider it acceptable, but very rarely. In other situations, he says that he's all right, even when it is obviously not the case. But admit it - then fear to invade the area. Dislikes undergo massive emotional attack, since it provokes a change in the internal state that it's scary. If the fourth function can not find a comfortable location and you can not leave, it can sometimes be included minus fourth. So there are people who   love begin to pour out his soul to random passengers on the train, like a new place of work "complain to the vest." Thus, he seeks contact with the outer harmony of the world and when someone says to him: "Do not worry, everything is bound to be good", the place becomes at once good and can work again on the fourth function. Once triggered, it can be a good way to give yourself a comfortable place to stay "on the pre-emption." He can first begin to pour out the soul at the first sign that the place may not be comfortable, and only then include a fourth. And even begin to be curious to issues of internal human problems that then it was easier for them to talk.

<p><b>1 function "good" - the object of ethics. "I was impossible not to love!"</b><br />
Lives external relations between people, other people's emotions and feelings, knows how to please others, to create a positive atmosphere. Conservative in estimates of how someone who belongs to, including him, if only this ratio did not change - it can cause irritation in it, and the fact that someone does not agree with him on this. Strongly rejects those who treat them badly or general acts from base motives, they are for it - like a red rag to a bull. Affectionate to people,   he sure is cute. It knows how to appreciate people. Relationship perceived as   permanent and if the person has changed, they are never in it do not believe, as the relationship for them - a zone of conservatism. "Good" should be "good" and "bad" - "bad." If they begin to behave on the contrary - it is an irritant. Therefore, do not want to believe in a change in the situation with regard to "to   last "until the facts are already outrageous, and it can easily be said, say that to blame someone else. Never deliberately aggravates relations. Stable multiple personal relationships, communication organize the foundation of his personality. It can not be one, because if there is no relationship with someone,   if anyone is not needed, and I was not there. The world community should be a good, kind, loving and caring. Sometimes it can look for a place among the religious sects, as it is preached by the principle of "everyone should love everyone." If you can not win the feelings of others, it provokes in him an inner irritation, inferiority complex. They are the zealots such thing as behavioral norms,   so that people in certain situations, to demonstrate compliance with this situation, the feelings,   deviation from which they can be annoying. They need public. Any situation - is primarily a set of relations. The first function of the third: meaning that in his world everyone will love each other, if there's to be an external conflict, the blow comes from two functions, oriented itself, that is it - the strongest stress.
</p><p><b>2 function "must" - the subjective sensation. "I know how to cook sandwiches and I will be glad to someone to compete in it."</b><br />
He is a specialist in physical comfort, sensory pleasures, he likes to deliver his people. He likes cooking, approaches this issue is very creative, though sometimes -   too creative, as often dishes out too specific. Great experimenter in matters of a wide variety of sensory pleasures, loves their maximum diversity.   The proposal to try a rare exotic dish will be seen more often, "with a bang". Often -   good masseurs. Always taking care of loved ones in the physical sense. They know how to create coziness and comfort in some, not intended for this place. Creative and skillful in matters of medicine: if you find that you need to have an operation in the field, they will do it with pleasure without any experience. Generally I like to treat other people and make them healthier body, to conduct experiments on the recovery of the body, to doing it beautiful: hardening, changes in appearance, weight loss. Love also   taste anything: unexpected tastes, smells, physical sensations, and give it to the people all around. Worn all day with offers close "but eat berry", "smell like a flower smells good," "and you want massazhik do?", "Maybe you want a candy with jam?". If someone asks them about some sensory pleasure - it can be difficult to deny, in this context, can sometimes come at a fairly strange territory pleasures simply because someone about something asked. The second function of the first and third: always concerned about loved ones to the external situation was harmonious, well, sometimes even in passing on those generally sympathetic. The second of four: can sometimes attempt to "cajole" someone pleasing to him something explained, helped to understand.   
</p><p><b>3 function "Problems" - an object of intuition. "How to make sure that life was" raspberry "?"</b><br />
Be careful not to miss anything in life, do not keep up with the possibilities of the outside world. They go all out running,   just to stay in place. Their self-esteem is dependent on the external situation integrity, they are very worried that somewhere in this same integrity is broken: for example, someone in the family had a row - is necessary to run urgently "extinguish" the conflict, all to make peace, even if he has matured and all will better it somehow once "razrulit" that this does not come back. Until recently, they cling to relationships, even   if they have long been exhausted, so as not to destroy the integrity of the external situation. This can completely undermine themselves, but would not destroy Status Quo. If a neighbor has a vegetable garden, then they should immediately make it if   a new film, be sure to see it, to keep up with the world,   They can chase fashion. It's just not the pursuit of external harmony, and the marathon. He likes to be in nature, since it is constant and harmonious at the same time. Dislikes external contradictions,   incomprehensibility of the situation, constantly trying to clear it. It seeks to preserve the constancy of life situation, even where it is clearly not possible. In the case of active protection function - it simply upgraded, constantly adapts to the changes of the world, so that all can continue to remain unchanged for some time and the question of the integrity of the external situation is successfully resolved. When passive protection   man resigns himself to the fact that this is not possible, and let things take their course, falls short of life and recognizes the impossibility of preserving their idea of the perfect world in the surrounding area. Often they love holidays, traditions, as they also do exactly harmonizing function in society:   people are forced to come to terms, to be harmonious with the point of view of the external situation. They want to have it was "like men." His ideals are trying to objectify in the outside world: to create a perfect, fairy-tale world in which all will be well, perfect. To recognize the impossibility of it - means to kill self-esteem, so they often believe in fairy tales, like movies with "happy endami" to survive is a condition where the outer harmony failed. In general, often pay attention to the signs,   horoscopes, tarot cards, often religious: all that can provide at least some possible assistance in building an ideal world, set in motion. Magical worlds can only be built with magical ways.
</p><p><b>4 function "I want to" - subjective logic. "The keys can not be found where they are hidden and where the lighter and more clear to me where they could get there."</b><br />  
Man consciously looking for a place where everything is clear and it avoids those where something remains unclear, complicated, first of all from the point of view of common sense. It needs people who are able to clearly explain complex things, often tied to them for that reason. If you tell him that something would be difficult to understand that he will not try to figure it out, just run away. If you say it's easy, and it's clear it will be easy, because it is inspired by this. Very instill an understanding of other people and in general any logic, therefore, can easily believe in the strangest and   unrealistic things, them it is easy to convince. They love to go to learn, but those courses where in detail and clearly, all meticulously explained. Lectures, which just give the terms and facts, they fear, because each of them has to be meticulously explained to them first. There may be deceived by fraudsters because of the suggestibility of their logic, it is necessary to remember it always. Someone must constantly explain to them that everything is simple and clear, then seat it will sound good. If you leave a situation where it is unclear that it is impossible, you can pretend to be a fool, or to pretend that it's not interesting, boring.   Angry at the people who know but refuse to explain what is not clear to him, he said that they thus scoff at him. The best habitat - primarily on 100% understandable and predictable.  
</p><p><b>- 1 function "Poor" - subjective ethics.</b><br />
The proper attitude toward someone or something man completely ignored. Instead, it is subjected   social suggestion. If all say that something "good", and that something "bad", then he will think and say the same thing, even if it is fundamentally not true. In addition, he never expressed his true relationship to anything aloud, he believes this is a very personal and highly intimate affair about   which to say it should not. Instead lives external relations between people. If it is forced to do so, it behaves as a "much in the pan", as it may be turned out to not look bad in the eyes of others. Maybe even especially to convince himself that he fully agreed with the opinion of the others, even if it is frankly wrong. This makes it a little disingenuous: he can not ignore the existing problems instead "to sing the tune of the" majority. When   decision in any society, it needs to change its attitude towards someone or something, it does it without thinking. Moreover, sometimes it can be ignored and their feelings. If the person who is liked, is a popular figure in the community, you can not this feeling just give value to calculate the feeling something unworthy of himself. Sometimes even your attitude towards someone just playing. In the situation   when the first feature may not function properly, it can sometimes include this feature.   For example, when he is forced to fend off attacks on themselves, then we can begin to openly rude, to say that someone is thinking about really. In this way,   there is a merging themselves with the outside world, and further problems once solved, as it becomes the view heard and have nothing to hide, it is possible to act "in the open", not hiding "behind a fig."  
</p><p><b>- 2 the function "Do not" - object sensation.</b><br />
Applications for force him allowed only in the most extreme situations. For example, when you were attacked, and then, perhaps, we can sometimes somehow "get out." That is some very rare situations, he raises the norm and deviation from this understanding does not like. Therefore, unwarranted use of force does not accept, and rudeness. Not really likes to strain to go to the goal "in that whatever the cost", to overcome difficulties. During the appearance, but are not to say that makes it very efficient in terms of the ability to create an image. With the money can not handle a lot of fun to spend,   sometimes gets into debt. Earn enough standard techniques to cover their small and not very joy and pleasure. Anyway, it is quite difficult to millionaire to become.   In a situation where there is no possibility of finding "work" in the field of subjective sensory over time - can sometimes begin to criticize the police actions of others, blame the rudeness, brawling, even "dissolve fists." This allows him to shorten the distance with the man, to soften it,   then you can have it and "regret" hug, "prigolubit", say: "Come to me, I do regret a little bit," and the problem of "work" is solved.
</p><p><b>- 3 function "Problem Solving" - subeknaya intuition.</b><br />
If outwardly everything went bad, harmony is not obtained, then the solution of this problem can be searched by the search of harmony interior. Sometimes - in alcohol, sometimes - through "stored" arsenal.   This can be a psychologist or auditory training, meditation, and maybe a girlfriend, which is able to lift the mood. In any case, he resorts to this only in situations when "all bad." AT   others may not think about their inner harmony, instead constantly solving external problems. Well, in general it is clear that we can not all always try to artificially "glue" just stupid "to extinguish the problem," driving them underground, because if they are, it means that we must think of something,   what an idea. If he learns to build on this, and the external problems are solved much easier. Otherwise, they will be stronger only be felt in the future.
</p><p><b>- 4 function "do not want to, I'm afraid" - the logic of the object.</b><br />
Afraid of the objective world factors. For example, you need to pass on the right, but is afraid to get behind the wheel, because he knows that it is difficult: you have to watch the road, to know and apply the rules and on time to switch the pedal and transmission. Therefore, most likely it will think that it is necessary to "pass on the right" to do anything without doing. In the house they "anarchy" may prevail for the same reason. After all, to make repairs, clean house, throw out all superfluous - it is necessary at least a little, but to work for fear zone. And this would not be desirable, therefore, it lays it all a very long time, until there will be nothing to breathe. Only then will have to "clean up the balcony", put all trash in places or throw. He was scared to begin to implement their plans and ideas.   After all, he was immediately intrudes into the territory of fears. Therefore, most of it and will reflect on the theme of "to be or not to be" than actually make a decision to do something, to change. He does not like it when he just tell the facts, without explaining what they mean. Better then not to speak, because it scares him. The doctor came and said that he had herpes, ordered to smear green paint and then ran away,   without explaining anything. Serious situation: What if this terrible disease? And I do not even understand it.   If in some place it all seems confusing and impossible to escape from there, sometimes this function is activated. Then he begins to talk about topics that he knows for sure: to say that the earth revolves around the sun, and if someone picks it, explain it, and why it is happening. In this way,   matter of understanding will be removed and the location will become yet more comfortable.

It is very affectionate to his understanding of anything, his thinking, his logic, concepts, confident and conservative in this, convince impossible to "live" this does not necessarily sharing it with others. If you do not converge with the facts, sometimes even "the worse for the facts." Trying to criticize it causes irritation in it. Is able to reason logically, but does not like to defend his vision of the situation: "Who knew - he knew the rest is not given", so often surrounds himself with the concept of "my school" - those who accept his logic judgment and will not go to criticize. It is very hard for a long time changing its logical conclusions: Time needed for error judgment. He likes to get away with the way he understands it. If this can not be achieved - there is irritation. Therefore, they can only persuade weighty arguments, and the new information it receives is often skeptical, if he is not sure of this: you need to all carefully weighed before saying "yes." His thinking is fundamental, thorough, something that can be "lean" in which case, so there should be no risk of them and difficult to demand that someone's thoughts instantly approves. In general, try to understand everything first, and only then take for yourself. If something can not understand the development of the material it is more difficult because it is difficult to accept for themselves. So often is a very long time to learn something before you use, even if the question is very simple. The first function of the third: it means their understanding of how to be healthy.

</p><p><b>2 function "must" - an object of intuition. "Peace, harmony, and who are not harmonious - the guillotine will tell us."</b><br />
The purpose of this human life - to improve, harmonize the world, to build the integrity of the external situation. So sometimes they are quite ruthless to those who would destroy it. Skillful maneuvering capabilities in flow - their horse and they approach this issue very creatively. They know what and how you can improve elsewhere. They know how to make out the situation in the parts and assemble in a more harmonious, modernized sound, generators are often bold ideas "bestow happiness of mankind." Look for a place where there is chaos, there to organize everything. They know how to help a person to understand some complex external problem in an original way, "razrulivat" external conflicts between people to finish something for others, have the talent innovator. Sometimes, however, some business they may unwittingly end up not lead, because then they become unnecessary. Therefore, the perfect world for them - it is a dead world, something to improve it should always be. May often seek to use art as a way to create external harmony, able to create a harmonious atmosphere anywhere. "Storytellers", seeking to create a situation of perfect peace, perfect people. But that's really living in it does not always fit, often can see the solution to this "nesostykovochka" in need "drastic measures" to them. They like to educate people, say, thrown by someone near the urn bottle can provoke them to it, even if it is not safe in any situation, as it is - their "product". The second function of the third: harmonize the world in terms of its safety, security and health. Can be a lot of talk about it. The second function of the first: sometimes talk about their understanding of what needs to be done to make the world a better place. The second of four: sometimes can also talk about how to improve the world, so that later you all loved and respected.
</p><p><b>3 function "Problems" - the subjective sensation. "Sandwiches must be safe for health and healthy!"</b><br />
Most of the worries cause health issues, utility / harmfulness, and reliability is evident. They often - walking guides to medicine, know when to take that in the event of sickness. These questions are the area of self-esteem, so in these matters, they are not afraid to overdo it: winter swimming, training, jogging in the morning, drink specialty products to promote health. Often addicted and alternative medicine, their interest in attracting all that can somehow improve health, they are always talking about it. The slightest danger to him they perceive very boyaznenno: when it's cold - they are the first to notice that an urgent need to dress warmer. Can ask to reduce the speed when someone goes quickly by car. Any threat to health is considered invalid, even taking off screw door of the car is perceived as a potential threat to their lives and refuse to move in a way, always check the equipment, the equipment on the most insignificant occasion, never entrust the "packed your parachute," someone else. If they have any health problems, then this is for them a serious blow to self-esteem. With active protection functions will still seek to prove their physical consistency, to be torn in the front row "into the breach" (say, the first to run on clean-pull of gravity), and passive They will say: "Yes, I'm old and sick." Anything that can confirm them by their physical consistency, is it done in the first place. Therefore, they love exercise as a way to prove that they are still "hoo". The worst punishment for them - lie helplessly sick in bed in front of other people. They like to feel safe in medical terms from the organization in which they work. They - of the hostages of the word "useful", especially if it relates to health. Usually very care about social protection, duty to the people of the state, because they are afraid to get into a situation where "no one will file a glass of water." To convince yourself that health is all right, for them it is desirable to periodically somehow feel his body strength: hiking, climbing, marathon, triathlon, etc. If the test is passed, the health and can not be "something wrong."
</p><p><b>4 function of "I want" - the object of ethics. "Prices have a wife and kids, and not go to a neighbor!"</b><br />
A good place for such a person where it all like, well disposed towards him. If someone says treats him badly (for example, the wife says in her heart: "I hate you"), then takes it literally and tries to immediately get out of there, find a place where everyone will treat him well (or say that this is the case). Therefore, it is extremely difficult to be in places where they do not know who it belongs to him. The appearance of him as a man who tells them: "cool, man!" Is perceived as "the phenomenon of Christ to the people." It is suggestible to when they say who it belongs to him. He loves positive emotions of other people, as if they charged. Moves towards the reigning "most positive" emotions, positive emotions and avoid places of high concentration of negative. He dislikes situations of intrigue, scandal-mongering, since in such a situation can become a victim of their own. Therefore it is always bad refers to the "whispering a secret", seeing it as evil intentions. The relationship people always have to be open, honest, kind. Word about the relationship must always coincide with the chores, or - there is something wrong. Saying that you love a person - this has to be seen and, in fact, and if in fact it is not visible - it means it's not true. Very suspicious in regard to himself and others, suspecting some "zapodlo", even if it's some tiny little thing, already strives either immediately break off relations, or exclude a person from the number of "friends", relatives of people currently, reducing contact with him to a minimum. Therefore, it may sometimes be known as a traitor, finding those who belong to it better is out there and to relocate, considering it is a strong argument for changing the "range". It may become a victim of "sycophants".
</p><p><b>- 1 function "Poor" - Object logic.</b><br />
"If the world does not conform to my understanding of it, the facts - so much the worse for the facts." This position often provokes its isolation in society, since society is accustomed to the fact that a man is justified his expectations and the deviation from this principle may be considered "deviants." Powerful subjective logic, "the ability to look into the future" to work in the mode most often compensates the desire to ignore the facts. But where might the miscalculation associated with ignoring the facts of objective reality, one is confronted with a real problem, falling into a stupor, as the solution of such problems requires time due to the fact that the first function be unable to rebuild quickly. In life, it looks like this: a man running to the store, because he knows that he was there. And the ten years since closed. He does not like all these external rules, laws, regulations, even the Criminal Code treats as something strange that you can get around easily if you do not agree with him. Hates bureaucracy messing with documents unexpected facts of reality. The best technique for him - one that does not break if it is certainly not an expert on it. After an unexpected failure of a good thing can also be surprising fact of objective reality. We can say that the objective reality of the facts for that person - something that just should not interfere, contrary to his understanding of reality. If a person is talking on the themes object of logic, it is often critical of the laws, standards, the political system, which allows him to still be closer to the objective reality in a sense. If kakoy-to situation feels a threat to the normal operation of the first function: for example, its logic has failed, it may nevertheless start to pick up and retrieve kakie-to facts to protect its future logical constructions, even though it is not easy. Thus, reflecting external aggression to the first function, and eventually calms down. You may also start to pick up the necessary facts to defend their reasoning, for instance, in the dispute, if he knows that you have to "fight back fiercely." There is some kind of binding to their understanding of reality and of man himself enough whether adopted or not their opponents. Those, in turn, can be brought to the "white heat", as in this situation a person is not interested in their arguments, he simply defends his first feature.

He has a small set of relevant patterns of internal states, which he tries to fit himself and demand the same from others at the funeral should be upset at the holidays - be in high spirits, etc. Those who do the opposite - are wrong. Ideas and principles for it - is also something that is sometimes, but rarely needed, but as a statement of the form to achieve some goal, rather than on their own. In a situation where a person can not find a job for the second function may begin to criticize the ideas and principles of others, thereby better delves into their internal problems. This allows you to adjust its work to harmonize the external world, to match the real living people, not a "magic man".

If the "peaceful means" you can not come into contact with health, we have to take drastic measures are tough: hiking in the mountains, winter swimming, martial arts, exhausting diet, fasting marathons. That is, the worse the health of the more exhausting yourself all of this. If all so good, then all can be limited to collecting hobby medicine and ways to protect against the slightest threat to health. And if there are problems, then people will be more work on the creation of themselves "combat-ready fighting unit." It may begin to perceive your sexual stamina as a way to prove their health and begin to get involved in extreme sports: in fact the person who can be alloyed in the kayak on the mountain river - can not be weak.

Man afraid to boldly express their attitude towards someone or something. It is difficult to say that there is something he does not like. Instead, most will express their opinion a compromise only if it is very "boiling" or have nowhere to go. Sometimes, however, it can act allusions and jokes, so a little bit easier. The same applies to the personal sphere, to talk about their sympathies to someone can be difficult, scary. If this does occur, then the person perceives it is always very painful, especially if you can not find mutual understanding. Usually he hopes that people will be sensitive to each other, will be able to catch the hints on the subject of who and what I do not like, or vice versa, what someone wants. Feel free to say, "I want to," he does not know how much more he would say, "Well, you can", "would not mind", and maybe it does not say if the great fear. If some place and the situation is not comfortable with the point of view of the fourth function, but you can not leave it, then the person can start working on the minus fourth. Something similar may occur in unfamiliar, unusual situations. Suddenly, and for himself, he begins to "issue" the relation to something: that the "good" that "Bad", interested in the problems of other people trying to take part in them, to help somehow, be sensitive and responsive until it receives a positive assessment of the response. Then turn on the fourth and again you can start to work hard to please everyone.

<p><b>1 function "Good" - an object sensing. "I - the most powerful man in the world, rookie."</b><br />  
It is very self-confident in their own abilities, he believes that can do everything. Often the impression voluntarist: I think it's right, then it should be good for everyone. It produces an impression of a strong man, he seemed to always have enough space around, "like a bull in a china shop."   If he is physically strong, that despises "wimps", if the opposite is weak, then all athletes - "redneck". Often good handle money, but these issues are either too conservative or too cocky. Life is perceived through the prism of power "who is who". In order to be heard by them, you need to force yourself to respect in any way. Any weakness of man perceived as a disadvantage,   so often they can use it, not seeing anything wrong. Always do something, developing skills. Usually, their strength is visible to the naked eye, but it lacks flexibility, rather it is something monumental and conservative. Always try to be just the first in any case, if this does not work, something very angry. If their strength and ability to question, it should also be a flash of aggression. Potentially - excellent athletes, but a constant re-evaluation of their own forces is fraught with injuries. Preaches the cult of power and skill, confident in their external data. It asserts its exclusivity, uniqueness. He does not consider it necessary to get someone on the approval of this or that act, and the decision is made ​​by a very arrogant. Do not hesitate to use force anywhere.   Angry, annoyed, if someone it "contradict" and is externally visible. Sometimes, at first irritated, and only then is able to understand something of what was said to him, since the function irratsiaonalna, that is not connected with thinking. Listen to the opinion of the other side of the slope only when something could not be done by yourself or if it is necessary to use the explicit authority in his eyes, respect to you, he listened. He loves extreme situations as a way to prove to himself that he was living there. In addition, because it is easier to receive from society the right to approve their actions. First, to do something, and only then   They can understand what they have done. A man of action, act. Inclined to force the philosophy of chanting,   independent coping, victory at all costs, "could bear to fill up - a man."   Representatives of the opposite sex prefer to win, to take as a fortress strongest storm. And, always sure that everything here depends only on himself, his strength, capabilities. Hence - the extremely irritating when realizing that it was not possible to achieve the goal.   The weak point man - the inability to understand that not everything in life depends on him alone. Therefore, if a person does not achieve success in life, then it becomes very irritable, because at heart considers himself a loser. I am confident that looks and dress well. He was hard to be in a situation where nothing can be done to change, to be in "limbo", just wait for the right moment for action, not "touch off" all at once. They are constantly accompanied by a restless activity, workaholism. Not a minute without any action, which means that sometimes the inability to stop and think. If the air hangs a pause, it required some action. If they say something, it immediately sounds problematic action. The first function of the third: meaning that all must admire his qualities, strength, skills, actions. If it does not, then there is less self-esteem and psyche.

He likes long, detailed and creatively explain anything other than a teacher, a teacher, "I explain, while I listen while 100% will not be sure that everyone understood everything." Ask him questions - sometimes you can listen to the answer for hours, sometimes just looking for someone to speak out on "their understanding of something"   "Wriggle out" of this can be difficult if you do not talk about it straight. Something similar can be the object and the second logic function sometimes, but in this case the emphasis is not on facts, but on the fact that all necessarily all have understood, sometimes explained as children for this reason. This man is constantly looking for an audience with questions, but did not explain in terms of knowledge, but from the point of view of how he understands it, that is more intelligible and meticulously.   Loves find a range of applications: something that has not been studied and understood before, sometimes like to begin to explore the unknown for itself a sphere in which they have no qualifications, as this allows us to develop the scope of "understanding" something that is very tempting for the creative function. The second function of the third: likes to talk a lot about relationships, psychology. The second function of the first and fourth sometimes likes to talk about what we need to be strong, successful and principled.

It is important that all treated him well. He does not like ambiguity in this matter and constantly seeks to clarify the situation: "Let's find out all the same, you respect me or not?". Clarification of this issue could cause any little thing: face, eyes, and so on. Often with age becoming   also good psychologists, since it allows you to maintain a good self-esteem. It is fixed on the relation to his particular people and ignores the "public opinion". Very susceptible to social recognition: honor, glory, respect, letters, insignia, etc. For the sake of good relations can sometimes be up to him and to work away for free, to help someone to do something of a sense of camaraderie. If the environment appears someone whose feelings for him negative, it causes a drop in its self-evaluation. With its active protection - it will try to win the good attitude of man at any cost, passively - on the contrary, it can say something like: "I'm here now so bad." If there is a good relationship, you may try to adjust them at any cost, or, conversely, to avoid them in the case of realization of the impossibility to change something. Susceptible to any flattery, often ready to support any opinion, and to compromise, you do not accidentally change the attitude to yourself, and if you do not agree with someone, it is very diplomatic. Speaking to representatives of this type - often feel internal stress associated with fear to cause me to film, so they often think ten times before you say anything. As if to refer to this as a job. Move up the career ladder often at the expense of the ability to be considerate of others.

Choose a place of stay, where do not experience internal discomfort, conflict with itself, where his ideas and principles are shared, and without any explanation. If this can not be achieved,   then just change it. They like people who know how to raise them up, to create harmony in the soul, "and sing-ka gypsy so that at heart I felt good, good." Strangers are taught good   mood   They do not like to be close to those who have it worse. Often alcohol is used as a means to "fill the soul" that is potentially fraught with alcoholism, and the person can be sure that so do all. Their main requirement for the location, not to cause controversy with their ideals and principles. If this is not the situation, then he leaves, saying that "it is - not my world, it is not interesting to me." There can be anywhere when the external situation "hurts the soul"   it causes some "itching".   If the place comfortable, then it automatically "all its" as the default share his beliefs, and from then on there are prerequisites in order to do what it sees fit. Therefore, love,   to be clearly received "with all the cockroaches", creating a microcosm of "their", which accept each other's shortcomings and live with it. Hence the attitude toward this world and the people inhabiting it, as his clan and himself are marketed as a "godfather." Existing in this world, he has already   It contrasted with the "other", who do not share its principles. Man is aware of the need to maintain harmony within the host, but it is up to the task rarely consults, as it constantly pushes somewhere. To retain her he needed a man who would be his intervention in time to extinguish the "flash", destroying it, something like: "Well, what are you so wound up, then? It's okay, all right. " Poor predictable in their behavior because of that, you never know what kind of mood will be a man today, and that it will work for this reason.  
</p><p><b>- 1 function "Poor" - the subjective sensation.</b><br />
Health issues in his area are ignoring. Can not completely aware of this component of the organism and passing others. Work can not rest, have a "bouquet"   neglected diseases, but absolutely not to attach any importance to this. Speaking on the topic sores considers   a sign of weakness. The best way to be healthy - in sports, in a pinch, you can just take a pill some. It may grow into bad habits just because he does not see anything wrong in them. Well, I drink in the morning to head ache - sober. The food is not fussy and not fussy. All hearty - and it is good. Ridiculed hedonism others. When the first protection function,   when it can not function normally, undergoes powerful criticism may also, in response to criticize other people's physiological weakness, disease, fear. As a result, his claim to the world more softened, as he begins to see "the other side of the coin": not so severely he demands from others and asceticism becomes better understood by others. Although, at heart, he, of course, like everyone likes to eat. But this - his secret secret that bears the status of "forbidden fruit". So, can often be specially ordered some tasty dish under some false pretext, for example, supposedly for kids, but he sits there and "eats" it "for both cheeks" for the company with  them.
</p><p><b>- 2 the function "Do not" - Object logic.</b><br />
He does not like the changes in the rules and the laws of the external world. They just have them and he adheres to, even though it is not easy. He taught them and they should only be where it is strictly regulated by the society:   rules of the road, coming to work on time, payment of taxes, the penal code and is waiting for the same from others. But to meet with friends can be late and that he does often. The inversion of the situation, which is sometimes still happens if you can not be realized by the second function in the world, begins to criticize the political system existing in the world of laws and regulations, an objective order of things. The result is a more objective assessment of the facts of external reality, and it is, sooner or later,   it is a job for the second function.
</p><p><b>- 3 function "Problem Solving" - subjective ethics.</b><br />
To solve the problem of self-function, you need to all be loved. But to achieve this,   and sometimes need to communicate to people that treat them well, they like to. All   The problem is that this function is used as a stop-gap of force majeure for the third function.   Therefore, if all is well, then work on it people will not be until the real problems. If he gets into the team, where you have to win the respect, yes, and he will try to express their sympathy to him. But if he knows that in his family, in any case, he will be respected, and it can do everything,   he pleases, until you start to arise in this place real problems: for example, the threat of the collapse of the family. And the result is a very strong contrast: for "their" people seems "petty tyrant", but the rest of it seems to be "the soul of society." As soon as someone else, the person   It becomes a "pious," and when he left - again "concerts", "one-man show." Here a person stores a lot of money to solve the problems of the third function: knows when to smile at the right moment to express my admiration for anything, ask the other person's problems, volunteered to help solve them. But he only uses it to solve their problems: existing and potential, in the anticipation. It is better to be safe once again, and to praise someone, than if he somehow offended. These feelings in this situation are driven underground and can unexpectedly for him to break out, ruining relationships. And often they are pulled out just where   "Possible" - that is, among the "friends". That creates a potential threat to "domestic tyranny." 
</p><p><b>- 4 function "do not want to, I'm afraid" - an object of intuition.</b><br />
They do not like it when everything is too good harmony in the external world. It is necessary to create a conflict at once,   destroy it, inflame passions, to prove that this world - it's just an illusion, but in fact it is not so good. Full recognition as the future scares him, so it can "buck" and create a breach in the integrity of the external situation, destroying it quiet for the presence of such a threat to themselves. But now I wonder if he thinks. And also can be in the "extreme" condition, adrenaline, to take decisions that will determine the future of all in your hands. Immediately he feels that he is living. A whole world of harmony - is not the world, but just a swamp. Some with them together is difficult not to live, but even the rest: all tuned to the positive, come to have fun and   Suddenly some passion-cheeky, "concerts" and "one-man show." And the thing that scares them the whole external positive and harmony. We need them necessarily enemies, problems, chaos of the outside world, then life has meaning. Also, they do not believe the unexpected beneficial suggestions are afraid of them - looking at this once some kind of trick. They say, free cheese is only in a mousetrap. They can often change jobs, so it was not too predictable in their lives. However, sometimes, in the case of the inability to find a comfortable location to subjective intuition, can start to talk on the theme of harmony of the outside world.   For example, it would be nice to play music, to create a relaxing environment. As a result, if it's all done, it calms him down and inside, the place becomes comfortable.

<p><b>1 function "good" - the object of ethics. "I was impossible not to love!"</b><br />
Lives external relations between people, other people's emotions and feelings, knows how to please others, to create a positive atmosphere. Conservative in estimates of how someone who belongs to, including him, if only this ratio did not change - it can cause irritation in it, and the fact that someone does not agree with him on this. Strongly rejects those who treat them badly or general acts from base motives, they are for it - like a red rag to a bull. Affectionate to people,   he sure is cute. It knows how to appreciate people. Relationship perceived as   permanent and if the person has changed, they are never in it do not believe, as the relationship for them - a zone of conservatism. "Good" should be "good" and "bad" - "bad." If they begin to behave on the contrary - it is an irritant. Therefore, do not want to believe in a change in the situation with regard to "to   last "until the facts are already outrageous, and it can easily be said, say that to blame someone else. Never deliberately aggravates relations. Stable multiple personal relationships, communication organize the foundation of his personality. It can not be one, because if there is no relationship with someone,   if anyone is not needed, and I was not there. The world community should be a good, kind, loving and caring. Sometimes it can look for a place among the religious sects, as it is preached by the principle of "everyone should love everyone." If you can not win the feelings of others, it provokes in him an inner irritation, inferiority complex. They are the zealots such thing as behavioral norms,   so that people in certain situations, to demonstrate compliance with this situation, the feelings,   deviation from which they can be annoying. They need public. Any situation - is primarily a set of relations. The first function of the third: to be successful in the private sphere, or is a double blow to both functions, aimed at himself and a lot of stress.
</p><p><b>2 function "It is necessary to" - subjective intuition. "My ideals and principles safely carry to the masses."</b><br />
They like to be self-contradictory people "dig" in them, create in them an internal harmony, mood. They make excellent actors, as they are able and like to "get used" to the image of a person from the inside, and to "play a role" on his face. Able to understand the essence of complex internal situation - potentially good analysts. Often it is difficult to find employment, as their "product" -   This inner human conflicts, and to penetrate so far, "the soul" of a person, you need to have permission. So often sensitive and vulnerable, just to harmonize ourselves again, "it is no longer necessary to nobody", and sometimes even start to like torture and istezat yourself, dig into their sores. The reason - the difficulty to find adequate application in the world for its creative function, since it is not very much in demand, because not every let anyone dig into its own internal problems. Their product - bold ideas, principles, belief systems and knowledge that they bring to the world, are promoting. But do it beautifully, creatively, "fine", not imposing them, and promoting interesting. Engaged in search internally contradictory situations, like to understand them. Unable to find a use, often implemented in art, since it is also a good way to use the function. Able to go to different internal psychological states. A good speaker, as is able to act positively on the internal state of the others in terms of harmony. Their product - it is the integrity of the internal situation, can therefore be implemented successfully and in psychology, because it means that they - healers of souls. In life, they like to dramatize everything, the slightest change in your mood or the internal state necessarily heard before all around. Usually they are very fond of "inflate out of molehills", for them it is - a way to find a job on the second function, the more they "fall out" - the greater the realization of the individual in the world. The second function of the third: "to be or not to be? That is the question". The second function of the first and fourth: can try to induce sympathy with stories about his mental anguish, complaining that his frustrating misunderstanding something.
</p><p><b>3 function "Problems" - object sensation. "That would be me to take the first prize in the competition to identify the strongest man in the world!"</b><br />
The most important thing in life to be rich, powerful, beautiful, successful, skilful. Take it as a challenge and this depends on his self-esteem, so it is very much worried about it. If something does not add up - it takes on the character of the disaster. Often loves to dress up bright, catchy, provocative, as a way to challenge others, to prove her beauty and success. Ruin, old age, social failure, ugliness in terms of social standards for a man sometimes can become a reason for suicide. In the protection of self-esteem in the negative - may cease contrary to monitor the appearance, go unkempt. In general, they tend to believe that the profession needed to go on time, so as not to disgrace. Be careful not to look weak and loved to show himself brave, strong, why can often, for instance, engage in martial arts, "the show" to learn some dangerous stunts and wherever possible, to show them, as well as sports. Man needs to be constantly taking new heights and that, oddly enough, their weak point. Sometimes, if everything went smoothly in their lives at some point can drop everything and go to another city, to "start over", thus improve self-esteem. Very strongly socially determined, if someone needs something - then automatically it becomes necessary for some reason, and to him and he starts to try to get it by any means. The fact that the best way is for him and lies close, only to reach out enough, it is usually not just wondering if it is not necessary to win. Hence it may be similar problems in personal relationships, constantly turning the race for the unattainable. And as soon as it becomes achievable, and all interest is lost, the paradox. To be able to overcome everything and win - the main motive of their activity. The worst thing for them - play, which means shame. Because of this, they do not like to get involved in those businesses that are too difficult to win. After all, the third function can be no risk: usually raises difficult, even very difficult task, but doable and achievable. Most often they are associated with existing skills rather than developing new ones. They need social success, universal recognition of their victory. Sometimes it can be tricky to come up with ways to improve self-esteem:   suddenly ill, then treated hard, recover and take it as his own achievement, victory.
</p><p><b>4 function "I want to" - subjective logic. "The keys can not be found where they are hidden and where the lighter and more clear to me where they could get there."</b><br />  
Man consciously looking for a place where everything is clear and it avoids those where something remains unclear, complicated, first of all from the point of view of common sense. It needs people who are able to clearly explain complex things, often tied to them for that reason. If you tell him that something would be difficult to understand that he will not try to figure it out, just run away. If you say it's easy, and it's clear it will be easy, because it is inspired by this. Very instill an understanding of other people and in general any logic, therefore, can easily believe in the strangest and   unrealistic things, them it is easy to convince. They love to go to learn, but those courses where in detail and clearly, all meticulously explained. Lectures, which just give the terms and facts, they fear, because each of them has to be meticulously explained to them first. There may be deceived by fraudsters because of the suggestibility of their logic, it is necessary to remember it always. Someone must constantly explain to them that everything is simple and clear, then seat it will sound good. If you leave a situation where it is unclear that it is impossible, you can pretend to be a fool, or to pretend that it's not interesting, boring.   Angry at the people who know but refuse to explain what is not clear to him, he said that they thus scoff at him. The best habitat - primarily on 100% understandable and predictable.  
</p><p><b>- 1 function "Poor" - subjective ethics.</b><br />
The proper attitude toward someone or something man completely ignored. Instead, it is subjected   social suggestion. If all say that something "good", and that something "bad", then he will think and say the same thing, even if it is fundamentally not true. In addition, he never expressed his true relationship to anything aloud, he believes this is a very personal and highly intimate affair about   which to say it should not. Instead lives external relations between people. If it is forced to do so, it behaves as a "much in the pan", as it may be turned out to not look bad in the eyes of others. Maybe even especially to convince himself that he fully agreed with the opinion of the others, even if it is frankly wrong. This makes it a little disingenuous: he can not ignore the existing problems instead "to sing the tune of the" majority. When   decision in any society, it needs to change its attitude towards someone or something, it does it without thinking. Moreover, sometimes it can be ignored and their feelings. If the person who is liked, is a popular figure in the community, you can not this feeling just give value to calculate the feeling something unworthy of himself. Sometimes even your attitude towards someone just playing. In the situation   when the first feature may not function properly, it can sometimes include this feature.   For example, when he is forced to fend off attacks on themselves, then we can begin to openly rude, to say that someone is thinking about really. In this way,   there is a merging themselves with the outside world, and further problems once solved, as it becomes the view heard and have nothing to hide, it is possible to act "in the open", not hiding "behind a fig." 
</p><p><b>- 2 the function "Do not" - an object of intuition.</b><br />
Outside balanced and predictable world - not his world. He loves spontaneity appearance schedule - only in general terms, mostly associated with the work. After that, everything can and must go "as he likes his left leg." He was not very interesting to be in a world where all too well and predictably, it is necessary   once there to sow intrigue, to make everyone to move, to act, that started some action. If it will have to take on a negative role - then so be it, but it's still better than   if all drown in the swamp with a predictable end of a fairy tale from the category of "and they lived a long life and died in one day." Usually I like to find a profession where one has not very much to strictly follow   some daily routine, schedule or just likes to frequently change it. However, in certain situations, of course, it is necessary to strictly follow it, but it is - only in special cases. This can be a job or military service, and may still be a need to create a peaceful external environment for those he loves. It all depends on what he puts into it is the concept of "normal". They obey hard, but still need sometimes. All the rest of the time should take place in "free flight". However, in a situation of prolonged stress and the inability to be realized in the world for the second function, the inversion can occur - the displacement minus the second function of the second. Then he begins to constantly criticize the world around and its foundations. The result is those can be   as uncomfortable to live in it, and it would be useful to help establish the integrity of the internal situation,   spiritual harmony as a result. Thus, it is to work.
</p><p><b>- 3 function "Solving Problems" - the subjective sensation.</b><br />
To be able to a lot of things in life and to achieve - you need to have an iron health. Therefore, if   ill, then immediately stored "kilos" of drugs. Start to really monitor their health only if often ill, while avoiding harmful habits, running in the morning. It may begin to harden, to be examined at the hospital, to monitor the utility power, but it is only in this case.   In all the other can run their health, not to engage in sports.
</p><p><b>- 4 function "do not want to, I'm afraid" - the logic of the object.</b><br />
Afraid of the objective world factors. For example, you need to pass on the right, but is afraid to get behind the wheel, because he knows that it is difficult: you have to watch the road, to know and apply the rules and on time to switch the pedal and transmission. Therefore, most likely it will think that it is necessary to "pass on the right" to do anything without doing. In the house they "anarchy" may prevail for the same reason. After all, to make repairs, clean house, throw out all superfluous - it is necessary at least a little, but to work for fear zone. And this would not be desirable, therefore, it lays it all a very long time, until there will be nothing to breathe. Only then will have to "clean up the balcony", put all trash in places or throw. He was scared to begin to implement their plans and ideas.   After all, he was immediately intrudes into the territory of fears. Therefore, most of it and will reflect on the theme of "to be or not to be" than actually make a decision to do something, to change. He does not like it when he just tell the facts, without explaining what they mean. Better then not to speak, because it scares him. The doctor came and said that he had herpes, ordered to smear green paint and then ran away,   without explaining anything. Serious situation: What if this terrible disease? And I do not even understand it.   If in some place it all seems confusing and impossible to escape from there, sometimes this function is activated. Then he begins to talk about topics that he knows for sure: to say that the earth revolves around the sun, and if someone picks it, explain it, and why it is happening. In this way,   matter of understanding will be removed and the location will become yet more comfortable.
</p><p><b>Summary description:</b><br />
Rational, which means the internal predictability and consistency. External manifestation of the contrary is very unusual: clothing, work, "product". The first function of a highly   events, which makes it even more conservative and may be considered as a negative factor.   The main "product" is connected with the improbable events that can be considered as a negative factor due to its even more non-standard. All together, this gives a very powerful contrast: the internal and external conservative exaltation. Because of this, it can have serious problems of misunderstanding with the outside world: both in life and in the work that it is extremely important to bear in   mind. Extraverted type, it means that he sees himself part of the world, not something out of it isolated. To itself it seems clear and simple, so do not hesitate to tell something about themselves and the world around him seems to be complicated, difficult to understand, so he does not know how to manipulate, distribute commands instead with interest studying it. Dominant requirements relate to functions focused on themselves and not on the surrounding world. This allows him easy enough to move from place to place, migrate, adapt to changes in the outside world (the tendency to sanguine temperament - balanced, agile). It also adds to it an element of self-confidence. The active position in life due to the fact that the dominant need is on the first function. Not very active in the work due to the fact that the subdominant need - in the second. Living in a stream of high-quality information, which means the ability to see well the right direction, but to benefit from it are not always due to the inability to work on it. It is very useful to find an assistant who can work, who would help him to achieve the desired objectives.

<p><b>1 function "Good" - subjective logic. "I know all the best!"</b><br />
It is very affectionate to his understanding of anything, his thinking, his logic, concepts,   confident and conservative in this, convince impossible to "live" this does not necessarily sharing it with others. If you do not converge with the facts, sometimes even "the worse for the facts." Trying to criticize it causes irritation in it. Is able to reason logically, but does not like to defend his vision of the situation: "Who knew - he knew the rest is not given", so often surrounds himself with the concept of "my school" - those who accept his logic judgment and will not go to criticize. It is very hard for a long time changing its logical conclusions:   Time needed for error judgment. He likes to get away with the way he understands it. If this can not be achieved - there is irritation. Therefore, they can only persuade weighty arguments, and the new information it receives is often skeptical, if he is not sure of this: you need to   all carefully weighed before saying "yes." His thinking is fundamental, thorough, something that can be "lean" in which case, so there should be no risk of them and difficult to demand that someone's thoughts instantly approves. In general, try to understand everything first, and only then take for yourself. If something can not understand the development of the material it is more difficult because it is difficult to accept for themselves. So often is a very long time to learn something before you use, even if the question is very simple. The first function of the third: meaning that all the terms of his understanding right and principled, consistent in this his vision. If it turns out that this is not the case, then there is a "double blow" to himself.  
</p><p><b>2 function "must" - object sensation. "I am strong and I would be interested to fight with you."</b><br />
Creative and creative handling of power, money, different skills. Ideal coaches who know how to make others stronger than enough original techniques and instill some skills. His strength - flexible, sophisticated, trying to be relevant. Able to work effectively and quickly, sometimes doing several things at once, great financiers, the truth may be too risky in some way, so they can prosper and ruined several times for life. Compete love, in contrast to the first function, which is important primarily in the process, and not necessarily as a result - the first place immediately. Second they also arrange (as there is for which further work). "Extreme" is often like. If you can not be realized with this function, sometimes consciously fall into a very deep financial or physical "pit", then to carefully selected from it. Often become good athletes, they are able to go to win it creatively and professionally. Actually a lot of things can, can turn poverty into wealth elsewhere, well manipulated by people external data. Often it is very useful to invite him to some business, since he just knows how to do something so that it will produce real income. It has the art of possession by force when necessary - just "tighten the screws" for the good of the cause, when it is necessary - on the contrary weaken. Able to work with groups from these positions: to create the necessary balance of freedom and control for a particular situation. Therefore, there are good teachers from the viewpoint that children grow up at the same time not spoiled, and not clogged: where it is possible to encourage, and in some cases may "poprizhat" little, if "the cause." If he takes to train someone to something, it is often this turns out excellent results. Therefore, also often   - Parents are outstanding athletes who started their cooking from an early age. If you long to   accumulated negative on the value function, the output is obtained with the second function, so   it is very dangerous especially anger, provoke. It can be long enough to accumulate a grudge, do not give it value as a function of trying to be adequate to the outside world, "a good product", but at some point, "cup" overflows and it may cease to control anything:   It is the output of aggression, so that man can not understand himself, he did, and then - the consequences. Therefore, it is imperative somewhere physically discharged: sport, hobby, boxing pear at the worst. Well, it is better to allow negativity to go, and not accumulate till it there will not be much, it would be better for everyone. They know how to create yourself and others some image, work clothes, very creative in this, and creates some of its original canon, rather than chasing fashion and is often successful. If necessary, you are able to save money to live on small amounts of money. Sometimes it is so cunning in financial activities that can make money out of thin air. They love to handle and manipulate forms: collecting stamps, badges, cars, create INTERIOR draw. In childhood can be very loving to play with toy soldiers. Usually they do not like when touched his stuff, as skillful manipulation - their "product" and then you get them as if a competitor. They know how to handle things well,   that they served them for many, many years, it is an art of manipulation. The old - also in no hurry to throw away, so how can they still somehow try to use, and then find a job on the second   function. The second function of the third, "we must be able to defend their ideals and principles that should be good with his fists." The second of the first and fourth: can sometimes show you some of his "tricks" to achieve power, ways to make money, sometimes it can tell you how it is appreciated at work for professional qualities and skills.
</p><p><b>3 function "Problems" - subjective intuition. "It would not have to change yourself to yourself?"</b><br />
The zone is a self-integrity of the internal situation, internal harmony, consistency, integrity, ideology, inner peace. To protect the self-esteem they usually just need a little break away from the people in this matter, that they are not planted in him a kind of inner conflict, so the task is almost always cope successfully and actively protect it. From the side, they always seem to be very consistent and principled people. They always think, do and say the same thing, that is, never themselves do not conflict with the same waiting for the rest of someone for this reason that begins to consider them "too right". Any information taken them only when it does not carry the danger of destroying the internal balance, so it is very stubborn. Never make a deal with its principles. Usually very polite, restrained, closed and hidden, to impress principled, consistent person. The presence of positive self-esteem is ensured by the ideals that may correlate poorly with the surrounding reality, which may cause the actual disregard of reality. Effective in achieving specific goals, but it can do, "ahead", ignoring the outside world and his opinion. Good feel, when it is reinforced by the situation: profession, implying legitimacy of such actions and the means - protection from the point of view of society. For example: "I - a soldier and just doing my duty service of the motherland", to be understood "from me bribes smooth." Often preach idealistic principles, implying priority to ideas, the principle of reality. It knows how to lead the people, since he wants to believe he is not lying, but the truth believe in their ideals. They are important to maintain inner peace, so you need to feel valued correctness of their actions in terms of consistency, ideology. Where the situation is too ambiguous, it will be difficult, but it will try to resolve them through simplification. Basically,   series - "good", unprincipled, inconsistent - "bad." He does not like those who know how to sow internal contradiction, doubt in his heart. Even if he does something wrong, it's much more comfortable about it just never know, thus self-esteem will be protected, so most of these people, he simply ignores. For example, can think what they want to hurt him, and because their opinion does not matter. In general, anything that might disturb his inner world - is not taken into account.   "May I lose, but it'll be true to yourself." Very often, it is more important to them.
</p><p><b>4 function of "I want" - the object of ethics. "Prices have a wife and kids, and not go to a neighbor!"</b> <br />
A good place for such a person where it all like, well disposed towards him. If someone says treats him badly (for example, the wife says in her heart: "I hate you"), then takes it literally and tries to immediately get out of there, find a place where everyone will treat him well (or say that this is the case). Therefore, it is extremely difficult to be in places where they do not know who it belongs to him. The appearance of him as a man who tells them: "cool, man!" Is perceived as "the phenomenon of Christ to the people." It is suggestible to when they say who it belongs to him. He loves positive emotions of other people, as if they charged. Moves towards the reigning "most positive" emotions, positive emotions and avoid places of high concentration of negative. He dislikes situations of intrigue, scandal-mongering, since in such a situation can become a victim of their own. Therefore it is always bad refers to the "whispering a secret", seeing it as evil intentions. The relationship people always have to be open, honest, kind. Word about the relationship must always coincide with the chores, or - there is something wrong. Saying that you love a person - this has to be seen and, in fact, and if in fact it is not visible - it means it's not true. Very suspicious in regard to himself and others, suspecting some "zapodlo", even if it's some tiny little thing, already strives either immediately break off relations,   or exclude a person from the number of "friends", relatives of people currently, reducing contact with him to a minimum.   Therefore, it may sometimes be known as a traitor, finding those who belong to it better is out there and to relocate, considering it is a strong argument for changing the "range". It may become a victim of "sycophants".
</p><p><b>- 1 function "Poor" - Object logic.</b> <br />
"If the world does not conform to my understanding of it, the facts - so much the worse for the facts." This position often provokes its isolation in society, since society is accustomed to the fact that a man is justified his expectations and the deviation from this principle may be considered "deviants." Powerful subjective logic,   "the ability to look into the future" to work in the mode most often compensates the desire to ignore the facts. But where might the miscalculation associated with ignoring the facts of objective reality,   one is confronted with a real problem, falling into a stupor, as the solution of such problems requires time due to the fact that the first function be unable to rebuild quickly. In life, it looks like this: a man running to the store, because he knows that he was there. And the ten years since closed. He does not like all these external rules, laws, regulations, even the Criminal Code treats as something strange that you can get around easily if you do not agree with him. Hates bureaucracy messing with documents   unexpected facts of reality. The best technique for him - one that does not break if it is certainly not an expert on it. After an unexpected failure of a good thing can also be surprising fact of objective reality. We can say that the objective reality of the facts for that person - something that just should not interfere, contrary to his understanding of reality. If a person is talking on the themes object of logic, it is often critical of the laws,   standards, the political system, which allows him to still be closer to the objective reality in a sense. If kakoy-to situation feels a threat to the normal operation of the first function: for example, its logic has failed, it may nevertheless start to pick up and retrieve kakie-to facts to protect its future logical constructions, even though it is not easy. Thus, reflecting external aggression to the first function, and eventually calms down. You may also start to pick up the necessary facts to defend their reasoning, for instance, in the dispute, if he knows that you have to "fight back fiercely."   There is some kind of binding to their understanding of reality and of man himself enough whether adopted or not their opponents. Those, in turn, can be brought to the "white heat", as in this situation a person is not interested in their arguments, he simply defends his first feature.
</p><p><b>- 2 the function "Do not" - the subjective sensation.</b><br />
If ill - bit you go. In other cases, not particularly need to pay attention to this. Well, maybe especially harmful habits to grow still not worth it. Although, if it is not health harms, then why not? They do not fear the disease rather refer to it as to something humdrum. On their taste preferences and physiological does not like to propagate. Convenient - not convenient, tasty - not tasty,   how much of a difference? The main thing that was edible, it was possible to sit on this chair, in principle,   else - the small stuff. There may be, for example, only some simple rules and requirements for foods: cleanliness, taste normal. No commitment is required to try everything in life: oh, he loves any dish, and it will be there. Maybe try something exotic, but especially for the sake of this in   any respect do not want to strain. He does not understand all the talk of discharge, "but this in bed Oh, but this ah" because they do not see this difference in the special dividend for themselves, as well as that one dish a little tastier, more, but can useful. Not particularly fond of talking on all these topics   physiological and sensory pleasures diseases. He believes that they must be appropriate,   infrequent. Well, someone is sick, then we can talk a little. If there was something "good" -   great, but "shoot the breeze" about it on every street corner - a sign of bad taste. Maybe do not really   notice,   that he was somewhere not very comfortable to be physically. If a person can not find a "job" for the object itself senosoriki for a long time, you can start to work on a subject: he criticizes all this hedonism reigns all around, and it can be found through the "work" for the creative function. For example, think of a way to overcome bad habits of people, to instil in them the skills sport or teach you how to earn more money to all those hedonistic weaknesses.   This happens due to the convergence objective and subjective realities. It is also something similar happens when he starts to talk on all these topics, most of all, he does not like   gluttons and can laugh at them.
</p><p><b>- 3 function "Problem Solving" - an object of intuition.</b><br />
If the soul "something wrong", it is very useful to harmonize and external environment: play pleasant music, to create comfort in the apartment, clean up the backlog of cases. Then the soul is easier to calm down,   less will worry about something. It may be useful to establish a contact someone, make new friends, make friends with the environment at work, or simply meet up with friends, pobalagurit bit.   It may also be useful to see some opportunities that can offer the world and try to use them yet. Unfortunately, doing so only when the soul of "fire", the remaining time can be all of these questions do not pay attention. But the arsenal of all these tools at your fingertips. If the soul does not matter - calling a friend, offers to meet, "hoot" or is engaged   sports, fun little club. Or, finally accepts the proposal, which had not previously   I dare take until all was well. Also, if outwardly everything is done correctly it on   the intended plan, and less inner experiences in this regard. Often it covers self-esteem   it is in the face of personal plans, which considers it his duty to perform. This ensures integrity and consistency of actions, internal consistency. If the external   situation destroys inner peace, everything begins its "rebuild" sooner or later. Although the question is hard, painful.
</p><p><b>- 4 function "do not want to, I'm afraid" - subjective ethics.</b><br />
Man afraid to boldly express their attitude towards someone or something. It is difficult to say that there is something he does not like. Instead, most will express their opinion a compromise only if it is very "boiling" or have nowhere to go. Sometimes, however, it can act allusions and jokes, so a little bit easier. The same applies to the personal sphere, to talk about their sympathies to someone can be difficult,   scary. If this does occur, then the person perceives it is always very painful, especially if you can not find mutual understanding. Usually he hopes that people will be sensitive to each other, will be able to catch the hints on the subject of who and what I do not like, or vice versa, what someone wants.   Feel free to say, "I want to," he does not know how much more he would say, "Well, you can", "would not mind", and maybe it does not say if the great fear. If some place and the situation is not comfortable with the point of view of the fourth function, but you can not leave it, then the person can start working on the minus fourth. Something similar may occur in unfamiliar, unusual situations.

It produces an impression of a strong man, he seemed to always have enough space around, "like a bull in a china shop."   If he is physically strong, that despises "wimps", if the opposite is weak, then all athletes - "redneck". Often good handle money, but these issues are either too conservative or too cocky. Life is perceived through the prism of power "who is who". In order to be heard by them, you need to force yourself to respect in any way. Any weakness of man perceived as a disadvantage,   so often they can use it, not seeing anything wrong. Always do something, developing skills. Usually, their strength is visible to the naked eye, but it lacks flexibility, rather it is something monumental and conservative. Always try to be just the first in any case, if this does not work, something very angry. If their strength and ability to question, it should also be a flash of aggression. Potentially - excellent athletes, but a constant re-evaluation of their own forces is fraught with injuries. Preaches the cult of power and skill, confident in their external data. It asserts its exclusivity, uniqueness. He does not consider it necessary to get someone on the approval of this or that act, and the decision is made ​​by a very arrogant. Do not hesitate to use force anywhere.   Angry, annoyed, if someone it "contradict" and is externally visible. Sometimes, at first irritated, and only then is able to understand something of what was said to him, since the function irratsiaonalna, that is not connected with thinking. Listen to the opinion of the other side of the slope only when something could not be done by yourself or if it is necessary to use the explicit authority in his eyes, respect to you, he listened. He loves extreme situations as a way to prove to himself that he was living there. In addition, because it is easier to receive from society the right to approve their actions. First, to do something, and only then   They can understand what they have done. A man of action, act. Inclined to force the philosophy of chanting,   independent coping, victory at all costs, "could bear to fill up - a man."   Representatives of the opposite sex prefer to win, to take as a fortress strongest storm. And, always sure that everything here depends only on himself, his strength, capabilities. Hence - the extremely irritating when realizing that it was not possible to achieve the goal.   The weak point man - the inability to understand that not everything in life depends on him alone. Therefore, if a person does not achieve success in life, then it becomes very irritable, because at heart considers himself a loser. I am confident that looks and dress well. He was hard to be in a situation where nothing can be done to change, to be in "limbo", just wait for the right moment for action, not "touch off" all at once. They are constantly accompanied by a restless activity, workaholism. Not a minute without any action, which means that sometimes the inability to stop and think. If the air hangs a pause, it required some action. If they say something, it immediately sounds problematic action. The first function of the third: the quarry is very important, does not matter in what sphere. If   it does not, it means serious problems with itself, the internal imbalance.
</p><p><b>2 function "It is necessary to" - subjective ethics. "I know how to love dearly and will be happy to find someone who knows how it's even harder."</b><br />
Always convey to others their attitude to him, constantly manipulated by their attitude to others. See his destiny in hand their own assessments everything that surrounds them: what is good, what is bad. Sometimes it can change sympathy / antipathy several times a day, very amorous and fickle in this. Seeking a place where interested in his opinions on any subject. It is best to find themselves as artistic director since its assessment is uniquely accepted and people approve of what he requires from them. In it, too, is entitled to receiving a head, but the approval of others, in this case is considerably less. He himself refers to his estimates as "working time", something everyday and constant: first praise someone, then scolded, he praised again. Not being in a similar position - it looks less adequately, so often it is this is one of the incentives that they become and thus safely "sell" products, demand for which is very small in the society. Usually - none at all, as those of all criticizes, often no one likes.   It is often perceived as the one who comes "with its charter in another monastery." Just look and everything begins to evaluate, "this is good, this is bad," "like, but it is somehow not." It is interesting to be in a conflict situation, and if all is well, it may even provoke it, as if he has a job: to evaluate. Such people often win the sympathy of his involvement in the problems of others: they are aware of them, interested in them, can adjust to the interlocutor in this capacity, in order to better get in touch with him. Therefore one often make good policy. Their advantage - the ability to play on voters' requests to know exactly what they want. Their relations are seldom reliable, since it is very volatile today like tomorrow - I do not like, then - love again. Even hate them - something that is quite easily one can become love. For them, the feelings - it's just an interesting game. They know the value of the whole, so it is still fun to be assessors, tasters. Occasionally when a representative of the opposite sex, they leave without their assessment. Their assessments often serve as a moralizing, but very strange, because it is good today, and tomorrow - is bad and vice versa. Sometimes the situation forces to hide their assessment of "the opinions of others." For example, they can use this technique, "say ...". If clarify who is saying what, it turns out that it is so cleverly hiding their opinion. The second function of the third: "to be a good specialist, it is necessary to study a lot, like me." The second of the first and fourth: can sometimes express aloud his opinion on someone's willpower and desire to find the soul of people.
</p><p><b>3 function "Problems" - the logic of the object. "How I would like to receive an invitation to the TV show" What? Where? When? "And win!"</b><br />
Knowledge for the individual is paramount, supremacy factor:. "If something I do not know, I - bad" Therefore, they often say they know something, really do not know (often in the hope that it will learn later, and no one would guess that they do not really know). Or another option, while protecting the minus - sometimes you can hear more from them: "Oh, and I do not know, I'm so ashamed." It is also important for them to have some kind of a piece of its territory, where they have the opportunity to be in charge. They love to learn, since the acquired knowledge increases their self-esteem. Nothing pleases them do not like the resulting five on any subject. Very attentive to the objective reality: the violation of the planned order of things causing it stress. He loves to reinforce their knowledge of reference to an authoritative source, statistics, facts. But do not know how to analyze them in terms of understanding. His vocation - the keeper of the scientific knowledge. Can not stand the chaos of information that did not really clear. Therefore, usually, in such situations, it   easy "which we have the real facts? Here, let's take them to and repelled. " "If there is order in my world - I'm good, if not - then I'm bad." Have a property to idealize their "objective" picture of the world, authorities. That is, treat it as what it really is, even if you are wrong and all their facts "fried". Often become adepts of something, some kind of "order of things" and is widely implemented. Becoming a supervisor, usually planted on the ground it is "their" people who take their "order of things" and actions. It is very important notion: "I - master, master in my territory." Even it does not matter what her size: a room or an entire state, as long as it was accepted by all. Sometimes this results in a comic form: guard some area that feels entitled to decide whether or not to let you somewhere just on a whim. In private life this sometimes means greater demands on elected representatives: it is necessary fully to take all their external actions,   but it is also only possible to a certain extent. Therefore, they often realize that the search for the ideal, in principle, not possible. Violation of the order of things by any of the subordinates for them - a serious offense, too late - then destroyed his order. If he is not the boss - then it is important to know exactly what its terms of reference, or can not take someone else's "order of things." They love to command, if there is such a possibility: close, subordinates: Despite how far it extends the concept of "my territory."
</p><p><b>4 function "I want to" - subjective intuition. "Prove to me that I am principled and harmonious, and I - your forever, pack and take to his home."</b> <br />  
Choose a place of stay, where do not experience internal discomfort, conflict with itself, where his ideas and principles are shared, and without any explanation. If this can not be achieved,   then just change it. They like people who know how to raise them up, to create harmony in the soul, "and sing-ka gypsy so that at heart I felt good, good." Strangers are taught good   mood   They do not like to be close to those who have it worse. Often alcohol is used as a means to "fill the soul" that is potentially fraught with alcoholism, and the person can be sure that so do all. Their main requirement for the location, not to cause controversy with their ideals and principles. If this is not the situation, then he leaves, saying that "it is - not my world, it is not interesting to me." There can be anywhere when the external situation "hurts the soul"   it causes some "itching".   If the place comfortable, then it automatically "all its" as the default share his beliefs, and from then on there are prerequisites in order to do what it sees fit. Therefore, love,   to be clearly received "with all the cockroaches", creating a microcosm of "their", which accept each other's shortcomings and live with it. Hence the attitude toward this world and the people inhabiting it, as his clan and himself are marketed as a "godfather." Existing in this world, he has already   It contrasted with the "other", who do not share its principles. Man is aware of the need to maintain harmony within the host, but it is up to the task rarely consults, as it constantly pushes somewhere. To retain her he needed a man who would be his intervention in time to extinguish the "flash", destroying it, something like: "Well, what are you so wound up, then? It's okay, all right. " Poor predictable in their behavior because of that, you never know what kind of mood will be a man today, and that it will work for this reason.  
</p><p><b>- 1 function "Poor" - the subjective sensation.</b> <br />  
Health issues in his area are ignoring. Can not completely aware of this component of the organism and passing others. Work can not rest, have a "bouquet"   neglected diseases, but absolutely not to attach any importance to this. Speaking on the topic sores considers   a sign of weakness. The best way to be healthy - in sports, in a pinch, you can just take a pill some. It may grow into bad habits just because he does not see anything wrong in them. Well, I drink in the morning to head ache - sober. The food is not fussy and not fussy. All hearty - and it is good. Ridiculed hedonism others. When the first protection function,   when it can not function normally, undergoes powerful criticism may also, in response to criticize other people's physiological weakness, disease, fear. As a result, his claim to the world more softened, as he begins to see "the other side of the coin": not so severely he demands from others and asceticism becomes better understood by others. Although, at heart, he, of course, like everyone likes to eat. But this - his secret secret that bears the status of "forbidden fruit". So, can often be specially ordered some tasty dish under some false pretext, for example, supposedly for kids, but he sits there and "eats" it "for both cheeks" for the company with   them.
</p><p><b>- 2 the function "Do not" - object ethics.</b> <br />
External relations for them - something not very much and not always associated with internal. For example, being married, often can easily meet someone else, not seeing it as something bad. barely   appearing in some companies may begin to pretend to be treated the same as all the rest of its members. Often this behavior may irritate people. In certain situations, it is still in compliance with any rules of external relations, but all of these cases - rare and strictly prescribed. For example - a funeral is not fun, it may be in relation to the employer   must be some scope permitted behavior, or it may even be similar cases it was his understanding of these standards. In all other cases it is simply grossly ignored. If all go on holiday to have fun - you can create a scandal, and when all upset - you can start to behave provocatively. Faux Pas - often their business card, with the exception of some cases which it builds in such a thing as a norm, then he himself will not tolerate violations. But what exactly it involves a particular person - depends on it, so This is all you need to keep in mind, taking into account this factor. If the object speaks on topics of ethics, it is usually negative. For example, something like:   "Me, too little family", "friends - do not spill water." The inversion of the situation is also beginning to criticize even stronger external relationships between people, and eventually begin to see them as still some sense, even remotely, as yet little start to analyze them. This makes it possible somehow, but to get closer to people, and then they can once again giving away their work for assessment as the second function.

Otherwise there is a risk of superficiality existing knowledge, especially if it is - your main specialty. They can strike at any moment. This may love to study, go to classes, hire tutors, even if already somehow good command of the question. Also, try to find people who are well versed in a certain matter, understand the nuances.

They do not like it when everything is too good harmony in the external world. It is necessary to create a conflict at once,   destroy it, inflame passions, to prove that this world - it's just an illusion, but in fact it is not so good. Full recognition as the future scares him, so it can "buck" and create a breach in the integrity of the external situation, destroying it quiet for the presence of such a threat to themselves. But now I wonder if he thinks. And also can be in the "extreme" condition, adrenaline, to take decisions that will determine the future of all in your hands. Immediately he feels that he is living. A whole world of harmony - is not the world, but just a swamp. Some with them together is difficult not to live, but even the rest: all tuned to the positive, come to have fun and   Suddenly some passion-cheeky, "concerts" and "one-man show." And the thing that scares them the whole external positive and harmony. We need them necessarily enemies, problems, chaos of the outside world, then life has meaning. Also, they do not believe the unexpected beneficial suggestions are afraid of them - looking at this once some kind of trick. They say, free cheese is only in a mousetrap. They can often change jobs, so it was not too predictable in their lives. However, sometimes, in the case of the inability to find a comfortable location to subjective intuition, can start to talk on the theme of harmony of the outside world.   For example, it would be nice to play music, to create a relaxing environment. As a result, if it's all done, it calms him down and inside, the place becomes comfortable.

Not very fond of arguing for an understanding of anything, because usually it does not give any dividends and it often irritates him in others. Well, do not argue, if you do not know this for sure, if you are not an expert in this field. But if the specialist - then, perhaps, there is little sense to discuss this. That is, there is a certain pattern of understanding, when it still needs to be done. And if someone could go into this territory more often that, it will irritate it more often.

Thus, the problem of self-protection is successfully solved. It is also much easier to love someone, and if they love you. Therefore, to clarify this issue, too, it is very useful from this viewpoint.

He was very afraid to be ill, infection, wash your hands "every five minutes". He does not like to be in health care facilities for treatment. In general, everything connected with his personal physiological sensations he does not like to discuss, and it scared other such revelations. If you feel bad, then   He prefers to "endure", rather than somewhere else to go for help. On his physiological   feelings does not like to tell: tasty - not tasty, convenient - it is not convenient. Most will say what   that from it want to hear in a given situation. At the same time, if it is in an uncomfortable situation and can not leave it, it can start to talk on these topics. As a result, someone "picks" and   He says something like, "it is necessary to harden, strengthen yourself, engage in sports, to become strong, then the match will not."

The main function is connected with the improbable events that can be considered as a negative factor, as well as a greater degree of its internal   exaltation and unpredictability. The second function is related to unlikely events, which is a positive factor because of its somewhat smaller than the standard.

<p><b>1 function "good" - the logic of the object. "My life - my rules ... for everyone!" </b><br />
It is very self-confident in its existing knowledge lives by external rules, "routine", "charter", invented by himself, forcing all its vision of "order of things" in the external situation and the conservative in this vision: who should do what, etc. . All things must be in place, moving them gives him a desire to put them in place. Very much the concept of "my territory", "boss", suiting a mess on it irritate people, "Every cricket stick to his last." The existing order of things is immutable, if you ask why it is necessary to do so, but not otherwise - the answers something like "so necessary", without giving a reason. As if living in what they do in the surrounding area hands, so a change in this is seen as an attempt to change themselves. Once having learned certain rule - followed him all his life (2 * 2 = 4). The existing old order has to be changed, if he comes to replace the new - it is already bad. The establishment of order in its place carries the status of self-affirmation. Well versed in the rules anything: to do something - how, and in what order you need to act, where to go, what documents. He knows how to assemble and disassemble anything, self-confident in this, can spend hours messing around with a soldering iron, details, to understand the complex mechanisms. If in my world there are stable and unchanging rules of procedure - that I live. If not - then there is no me. On its territory, always feel the main, do not tolerate objections. If the concept of territory he outlined more widely - it can spread this concept to anyone who is on it. For them, the house - it is an impregnable fortress. If they explain something that they understand - sooner or later they will say "clear" and will interrupt you, as to penetrate to the level of understanding they seek. They are interested in the facts of objective reality - and do not need to understand them, often you just have to remember, learn, compare and implement.   For example: how to assemble and disassemble the vacuum cleaner - do not need to understand, you just have to remember that where inserted. If the facts of its objective picture worlds are changing - then it is irritating, he needs time to rebuild it. The main criterion of activity - the objective benefits that can be obtained. To live with such a person in one territory can be only by its rules, and sometimes their aims to extend and strangers surrounding area as an extension of their borders seems useful work from the point of view of the person that lives and therefore it "exists" in an even greater extent. At least come somewhere in someone else's place and start talking, who is supposed to do - quite typical of him. Communicating with them - it does not leave the impression that he is always in the image of the boss bossy, even if he was not empowered this: "take a shovel, dig the potatoes go now." He does not like those who spend their time wasted, unproductive. He likes to ask again, on what facts established or that the judgment of anyone. The first function of the third: the successful implementation needs in the field of knowledge, science, or   career. Otherwise, both functions are aimed at himself, can produce powerful negative together.  
</p><p><b>2 function "It is necessary to" - subjective intuition. "My ideals and principles safely carry to the masses." </b><br />
They like to be self-contradictory people "dig" in them, create in them an internal harmony, mood. They make excellent actors, as they are able and like to "get used" to the image of a person from the inside, and to "play a role" on his face. Able to understand the essence of complex internal situation - potentially good analysts. Often it is difficult to find employment, as their "product" -   This inner human conflicts, and to penetrate so far, "the soul" of a person, you need to have permission. So often sensitive and vulnerable, just to harmonize ourselves again, "it is no longer necessary to nobody", and sometimes even start to like torture and istezat yourself, dig into their sores. The reason - the difficulty to find adequate application in the world for its creative function, since it is not very much in demand, because not every let anyone dig into its own internal problems. Their product - bold ideas, principles, belief systems and knowledge that they bring to the world, are promoting. But do it beautifully, creatively, "fine", not imposing them, and promoting interesting. Engaged in search internally contradictory situations, like to understand them. Unable to find a use, often implemented in art, since it is also a good way to use the function. Able to go to different internal psychological states. A good speaker, as is able to act positively on the internal state of the others in terms of harmony. Their product - it is the integrity of the internal situation, can therefore be implemented successfully and in psychology, because it means that they - healers of souls. In life, they like to dramatize everything, the slightest change in your mood or the internal state necessarily heard before all around. Usually they are very fond of "inflate out of molehills", for them it is - a way to find a job on the second function, the more they "fall out" - the greater the realization of the individual in the world. The second function of the third: "to be or not to be? That is the question". The second function of the first: sometimes talk about the need   implement their shared principles common to all the rules, it can be hidden by propaganda of any political system. The second of four: sometimes can admire sincerity of some   or collective rights.
</p><p><b>3 function "Problems" - object sensation. "That would be me to take the first prize in the competition to identify the strongest man in the world!" </b><br />
The most important thing in life to be rich, powerful, beautiful, successful, skilful. Take it as a challenge and this depends on his self-esteem, so it is very much worried about it. If something does not add up - it takes on the character of the disaster. Often loves to dress up bright, catchy, provocative, as a way to challenge others, to prove her beauty and success. Ruin, old age, social failure, ugliness in terms of social standards for a man sometimes can become a reason for suicide. In the protection of self-esteem in the negative - may cease contrary to monitor the appearance, go unkempt. In general, they tend to believe that the profession needed to go on time, so as not to disgrace. Be careful not to look weak and loved to show himself brave, strong, why can often, for instance, engage in martial arts, "the show" to learn some dangerous stunts and wherever possible, to show them, as well as sports. Man needs to be constantly taking new heights and that, oddly enough, their weak point. Sometimes, if everything went smoothly in their lives at some point can drop everything and go to another city, to "start over", thus improve self-esteem. Very strongly socially determined, if someone needs something - then automatically it becomes necessary for some reason, and to him and he starts to try to get it by any means. The fact that the best way is for him and lies close, only to reach out enough, it is usually not just wondering if it is not necessary to win. Hence it may be similar problems in personal relationships, constantly turning the race for the unattainable. And as soon as it becomes achievable, and all interest is lost, the paradox. To be able to overcome everything and win - the main motive of their activity. The worst thing for them - play, which means shame. Because of this, they do not like to get involved in those businesses that are too difficult to win. After all, the third function can be no risk: usually raises difficult, even very difficult task, but doable and achievable. Most often they are associated with existing skills rather than developing new ones. They need social success, universal recognition of their victory. Sometimes it can be tricky to come up with ways to improve self-esteem: suddenly fall ill and then be treated seriously, to recover and to take it as his own achievement, victory.
</p><p><b>4 function "I want to" - subjective ethics. "The love of good, and the darling kid." </b><br /> 
Seek to find yourself environment, a place where everyone will like them. If someone does not like it - a reason to change the situation. It is very suggestible, if we speak to him as to who should be treated. When you do not know how to treat someone, you feel uncomfortable, they are in need of people who have them explain it all along the way. Looking for a place for himself, where he will be allowed to communicate to all of its assessment, the attitude. If this is allowed - the place becomes a good. In this regard, it is very suspicious, so trying to find and often rely on any objective data. It is estimated to inspire people close to him, who can use it. So, if, having appeared in some new place, there is such a person - that it will try to catch it was his assessment and then to make them their own. For him, the best place where there is a close and trusted friends circle. He likes the situation in which he precisely and unambiguously sure how and what should be treated "black - white". If there is no such clarity - that he felt uncomfortable can. He was always very painful to part with the team, in which he worked, and the memories will bring forth therein nostalgia. It hurts to lose a friend, a comrade, a colleague with whom for a long time spoke. The same applies to personal life. Sometimes deliberately provoke a scandal somewhere as a legitimate way to express their attitude to anything, as the other assessment would require the approval of the team, and this assessment can express so. And then to go to its current estimates, that we can safely speak. If he feels for anyone's feelings - it can all turn a blind eye to all, as it is inspired by love, in his case, it is very blind. It is a feeling that it warms the contrary though any sense. In general, in such a situation the functions develops a very dangerous situation because a person can very easily be programmed to any feelings for anyone, and therefore action. And then simply push to do what he wants. And no hypnosis is not necessary - he will make the best of intentions.
</p><p><b>- 1 function "Poor" - subjective logic.</b> <br />  
It takes into account only the facts, such a thing as their understanding is completely ignored. Because of this, his knowledge can be very good, but too superficial to deep their understanding. This means that to create something based on them new it is difficult. If he is to explain something, sooner or later, he says,   "Understandable" and interrupts you. Dislikes new hypotheses, theories, concepts, since they have not yet checked.   It accepts only something that we can safely refer. Generally does not accept long lengthy discussion of the category of "Is there life on Mars?", Immediately called all windbags. If you tell him that "it is believed that ..." then he'll tear off in mid-sentence, not even giving the finish, "which means there is an opinion? And on what it is based on what evidence? ", Instead of a little think about it. In general, I never get into the theory that he did not need right now in practice. But if you can out of this is something to remove,   then yes, a useful thing. He needs to know the "in fact", and everything else is not interested. This feature means certain narrow-mindedness of thinking, inability to look at the situation from a different perspective.   His logic - not very flexible standard. It can be difficult to understand, say, Castaneda and other philosophers, expanding their horizons of thinking concepts. After all, it's simple and clear:   The earth revolves around the sun, and it is - only one of the possible truths on this subject, to understand can be very difficult. It was known that between two points can be carried out only one line, but came Lobachevsky created their geometry and it becomes clear that this is - also a certain convention. So, no "really" can be all in principle. However, when he defends his knowledge or can not ensure the normal operation of the first function, it may be better to try to understand something, make it easier to "fight" to defend the first function. In life, it also ignores such a thing as mutual understanding with people around them, as if trying not to bother with it, such as to adapt to other people. Also, it does not differ curiously, if   it is not practical knowledge, so it can "sin" a "die-hard".
</p><p><b>- 2 the function "Do not" - an object of intuition.</b><br />
Outside balanced and predictable world - not his world. He loves spontaneity appearance schedule - only in general terms, mostly associated with the work. After that, everything can and must go "as he likes his left leg." He was not very interesting to be in a world where all too well and predictably, it is necessary   once there to sow intrigue, to make everyone to move, to act, that started some action. If it will have to take on a negative role - then so be it, but it's still better than   if all drown in the swamp with a predictable end of a fairy tale from the category of "and they lived a long life and died in one day." Usually I like to find a profession where one has not very much to strictly follow   some daily routine, schedule or just likes to frequently change it. However, in certain situations, of course, it is necessary to strictly follow it, but it is - only in special cases. This can be a job or military service, and may still be a need to create a peaceful external environment for those he loves. It all depends on what he puts into it is the concept of "normal". They obey hard, but still need sometimes. All the rest of the time should take place in "free flight". However, in a situation of prolonged stress and the inability to be realized in the world for the second function, the inversion can occur - the displacement minus the second function of the second. Then he begins to constantly criticize the world around and its foundations. The result is those can be   as uncomfortable to live in it, and it would be useful to help establish the integrity of the internal situation,   spiritual harmony as a result. Thus, it is to work.
</p><p><b>- 3 function "Solving Problems" - the subjective sensation.</b><br />
To be able to a lot of things in life and to achieve - you need to have an iron health. Therefore, if   ill, then immediately stored "kilos" of drugs. Start to really monitor their health only if often ill, while avoiding harmful habits, running in the morning. It may begin to harden, to be examined at the hospital, to monitor the utility power, but it is only in this case.   In all the other can run their health, not to engage in sports.  
</p><p><b>- 4 function "do not want to, I'm afraid" - the object of ethics.</b><br />
Afraid of external relations. This means that he does not like all of these statuses, implying a real relationship: friend, companion, wife, cousin. Can escape from it all somewhere in the taiga, in the mountains for a month - another generally move to another city, so that they ceased to be for this time official, significant for him. Better something like: kind of like a friend, like a friend, like a relative and like his wife. It's easier and to nothing obliges. If someone expresses them clearly their sympathies, they often are afraid of this. It means - just start some kind of relationship with this person, even if he did not reciprocate, that is, it is better to "slip away" somewhere. The best option for them - a relationship without relations. Today, together, tomorrow, not together, the day after tomorrow - together again. commercials   families where the wife always on business trips, are seen on the big holidays. However, in any case, some kind of relationship building is necessary, at least with my parents, family, a small circle of friends. But this is the same reason why he can move to live in another city: there is a reason they enter is not very often.   If he can not find a comfortable location anywhere and you can not leave this place, you can begin to play the fool, to lift all spirits, to behave according to the external situation, to surrounding people also seemed to him a positive response to all this in the necessary positive way. Then it becomes a good location for the fourth function. In other cases, all of these behavioral norms appear to him as something unnecessary and frightening, usually in the office he heads breaks both his home and work hard to make special someone likes to think it beneath his dignity. The main thing to like yourself, then, maybe someone else will fit.

Very affectionate and conservative in his feelings and relationships towards anyone, faithful once had the feeling to someone. If someone with these estimates do not agree - it makes him a strong negative. Once deceived them - becomes for them a liar forever, even if reeducate. On the side is often perceived as a moralist, since his feelings and assessment - the main part of his life. But the fact is that since the main function of "product" does not like to be given out in the world, and often holds in itself - then it happens most often when something irritates him in terms of its assessments. That is, the negative is often seen brighter than positive. Hence, such a false impression of these people can be. Trying to challenge their assessment is useless, just something "good", and that something "bad". Explain the reason they will not be able to communicate clearly with the exception of common phrases. He tries to keep himself near those to whom once had positive feelings. They have a very clear division of people into 'good' and 'bad'.   "Good" like, as "bad" despise perfect hatred: often hidden, sometimes openly, especially if the person is very much a strong negative causes. If not enough people around him whom he loves, it could provoke in him the latent aggression, since it means that in this world it is not: after all, no one to love. They are very sensitive to such concepts as duty, honor, dignity, morality, of course - in their understanding. There are important own feelings, emotions and attitude to anything, rather than external, public, which may not be given importance.   Rarely changed his attitude towards anyone. Especially - from bad to good. It has a huge stock of a wide variety of emotions and their nuances. Very sensitive to deviations from their own morality the people around him as if they continually monitors in this regard and looks after. His positive feelings - this is something that from his point of view, you need to constantly validate the behavior that matches his expectations regarding the "good" - "bad." In society, it is too heavy in terms of understanding, because their ethics - personal, subjective, and therefore may deviate significantly from the public despite the fact that the people in it very much deeply "sitting".   You have to find just those who agree with it. The first function of the third: refers to the need for harmonious relations with the people he loves, or is full of "discord".
</p><p><b>2 function "must" - object sensation. "I am strong and I would be interested to fight with you." </b><br />
Creative and creative handling of power, money, different skills. Ideal coaches who know how to make others stronger than enough original techniques and instill some skills. His strength - flexible, sophisticated, trying to be relevant. Able to work effectively and quickly, sometimes doing several things at once, great financiers, the truth may be too risky in some way, so they can prosper and ruined several times for life. Compete love, in contrast to the first function, which is important primarily in the process, and not necessarily as a result - the first place immediately. Second they also arrange (as there is for which further work). "Extreme" is often like. If you can not be realized with this function, sometimes consciously fall into a very deep financial or physical "pit", then to carefully selected from it. Often become good athletes, they are able to go to win it creatively and professionally. Actually a lot of things can, can turn poverty into wealth elsewhere, well manipulated by people external data. Often it is very useful to invite him to some business, since he just knows how to do something so that it will produce real income. It has the art of possession by force when necessary - just "tighten the screws" for the good of the cause, when it is necessary - on the contrary weaken. Able to work with groups from these positions: to create the necessary balance of freedom and control for a particular situation. Therefore, there are good teachers from the viewpoint that children grow up at the same time not spoiled, and not clogged: where it is possible to encourage, and in some cases may "poprizhat" little, if "the cause." If he takes to train someone to something, it is often this turns out excellent results. Therefore, also often   - Parents are outstanding athletes who started their cooking from an early age. If you long to   accumulated negative on the value function, the output is obtained with the second function, so   it is very dangerous especially anger, provoke. It can be long enough to accumulate a grudge, do not give it value as a function of trying to be adequate to the outside world, "a good product", but at some point, "cup" overflows and it may cease to control anything:   It is the output of aggression, so that man can not understand himself, he did, and then - the consequences. Therefore, it is imperative somewhere physically discharged: sport, hobby, boxing pear at the worst. Well, it is better to allow negativity to go, and not accumulate till it there will not be much, it would be better for everyone. They know how to create yourself and others some image, work clothes, very creative in this, and creates some of its original canon, rather than chasing fashion and is often successful. If necessary, you are able to save money to live on small amounts of money. Sometimes it is so cunning in financial activities that can make money out of thin air. They love to handle and manipulate forms: collecting stamps, badges, cars, create INTERIOR draw. In childhood can be very loving to play with toy soldiers. Usually they do not like when touched his stuff, as skillful manipulation - their "product" and then you get them as if a competitor. They know how to handle things well,   that they served them for many, many years, it is an art of manipulation. The old - also in no hurry to throw away, so how can they still somehow try to use, and then find a job on the second   function. The second function of the third, "we must be able to defend their ideals and principles that should be good with his fists."

The zone is a self-integrity of the internal situation, internal harmony, consistency, integrity, ideology, inner peace. To protect the self-esteem they usually just need a little break away from the people in this matter, that they are not planted in him a kind of inner conflict, so the task is almost always cope successfully and actively protect it. From the side, they always seem to be very consistent and principled people. They always think, do and say the same thing, that is, never themselves do not conflict with the same waiting for the rest of someone for this reason that begins to consider them "too right". Any information taken them only when it does not carry the danger of destroying the internal balance, so it is very stubborn. Never make a deal with its principles. Usually very polite, restrained, closed and hidden, to impress principled, consistent person. The presence of positive self-esteem is ensured by the ideals that may correlate poorly with the surrounding reality, which may cause the actual disregard of reality. Effective in achieving specific goals, but it can do, "ahead", ignoring the outside world and his opinion. Good feel, when it is reinforced by the situation: profession, implying legitimacy of such actions and the means - protection from the point of view of society. For example: "I - a soldier and just doing my duty service of the motherland", to be understood "from me bribes smooth." Often preach idealistic principles, implying priority to ideas, the principle of reality. It knows how to lead the people, since he wants to believe he is not lying, but the truth believe in their ideals. They are important to maintain inner peace, so you need to feel valued correctness of their actions in terms of consistency, ideology. Where the situation is too ambiguous, it will be difficult, but it will try to resolve them through simplification. Basically,   series - "good", unprincipled, inconsistent - "bad." He does not like those who know how to sow internal contradiction, doubt in his heart. Even if he does something wrong, it's much more comfortable about it just never know, thus self-esteem will be protected, so most of these people, he simply ignores. For example, can think what they want to hurt him, and because their opinion does not matter. In general, anything that might disturb his inner world - is not taken into account.   "May I lose, but it'll be true to yourself." Very often, it is more important to them.

Inspires facts, figures, often misses a deaf ear to all but them. He likes to be in places where knows what the situation is - what to do. Inspires external order of things, which was at the time   his upbringing: the political system, social norms, etc. Therefore it is extremely sensitive to social change: as long as the order of things has not changed: "God forbid you live in interesting times."   Always moves in the direction of the highest order and places carefully avoids chaos, inspired by the order and very upset that he did not change then. In this connection, sometimes it attracts work in military structures, which has the force of statute. It is important that the situation elsewhere has been organized in accordance with his usual rules and laws do not contradict the facts of objective reality. It is also important to know who and where it should be, what to do. What documents need to collect, for what purpose, where they have to apply and how to fill. Most feel comfortable in a situation of definitive rules of action, without any admixture of subjectivity "in the case of something - to do something-something." Knowledge of the facts is often replaced in a particular situation a true understanding of its problems. Why it becomes superficial, just vault statistics noted by objective laws and regulations. He does not like long and detailed explanations. Immediately interrupts and says, "Well, in short, that there" really? ". There is a view that he wants to get a ready solution, usually, but not its justification. Eg. "2 * 2 = 4" Even rule. Loves terms, sometimes you can just tell them and they they will be enough. He does not like those who are destroying the norms of behavior in some situations, for example, it breaks the chain of command. Particularly inspired by the facts, which sees with his own eyes, if you can touch it.

Ignore the outside, the real relations between people in order to please their senses and their relation to something. Thus, could easily make enemies.

But he   I do not see, because this function is pushed out of his mind and all it can do easily. Can   demonstratively ignore external relations, as though not recognizing their importance: "Well, what if the husband and wife, I can see that they look at each other without the sincere feelings." As if every external relations - a complementary attribute of internal relations. Legally married - it's just an external confirmation of these same feelings if they are not, then it - no relation, and fiction. However, sometimes, when they can not work on the first feature comfortable, exposed on it attacks, defend against it or just talking on the themes object of ethics, they can they start to criticize, analyze, working on this function. In the end - begin to see them, at least partially, and to take into account. Then all these points, at least, it does not bear the same trouble as before.

Since it can be difficult to negotiate, since he seemed to "veer", going through life, "can be that way, but you can." Therefore, an attempt to clearly define the time with him and the venue can be an exercise in futility, "I'll be there first, then there is, and most likely, if all the time to be able, in the area so much, I'll be there somehow."   No perception of space and time as something permanent, which can not be moved, somehow, very roughly, vaguely, for the sake of accuracy of the meeting makes no sense to change the plans, thus destroying the harmony of the external situation.

He himself refers to his estimates as "working time", something everyday and constant: first praise someone, then scolded, he praised again. Not being in a similar position - it looks less adequately, so often it is this is one of the incentives that they become and thus safely "sell" products, demand for which is very small in the society. Usually - none at all, as those of all criticizes, often no one likes.   It is often perceived as the one who comes "with its charter in another monastery." Just look and everything begins to evaluate, "this is good, this is bad," "like, but it is somehow not." It is interesting to be in a conflict situation, and if all is well, it may even provoke it, as if he has a job: to evaluate. Such people often win the sympathy of his involvement in the problems of others: they are aware of them, interested in them, can adjust to the interlocutor in this capacity, in order to better get in touch with him. Therefore one often make good policy. Their advantage - the ability to play on voters' requests to know exactly what they want.

For them, the feelings - it's just an interesting game. They know the value of the whole, so it is still fun to be assessors, tasters. Occasionally when a representative of the opposite sex, they leave without their assessment. Their assessments often serve as a moralizing, but very strange, because it is good today, and tomorrow - is bad and vice versa. Sometimes the situation forces to hide their assessment of "the opinions of others." For example, they can use this technique, "say ...". If clarify who is saying what, it turns out that it is so cleverly hiding their opinion. The second function of the third: "to be a good specialist, it is necessary to study a lot, like me."

Or another option, while protecting the minus - sometimes you can hear more from them: "Oh, and I do not know, I'm so ashamed." It is also important for them to have some kind of a piece of its territory, where they have the opportunity to be in charge.

Have a property to idealize their "objective" picture of the world, authorities. That is, treat it as what it really is, even if you are wrong and all their facts "fried". Often become adepts of something, some kind of "order of things" and is widely implemented. Becoming a supervisor, usually planted on the ground it is "their" people who take their "order of things" and actions. It is very important notion: "I - master, master in my territory." Even it does not matter what her size: a room or an entire state, as long as it was accepted by all. Sometimes this results in a comic form: guard some area that feels entitled to decide whether or not to let you somewhere just on a whim. In private life this sometimes means greater demands on elected representatives: it is necessary fully to take all their external actions,   but it is also only possible to a certain extent. Therefore, they often realize that the search for the ideal, in principle, not possible. Violation of the order of things by any of the subordinates for them - a serious offense, too late - then destroyed his order. If he is not the boss - then it is important to know exactly what its terms of reference, or can not take someone else's "order of things."

Do not know how to count money and treat them all: not having time to get them,   soon spend, often live in debt. Do not know how to endure, wait to achieve goals achieved. Instead, consider that all this is - evil, and you just need to live happily without attaching any importance to this. Do not attach importance to the actions and deeds of others, as if carried away instead only themselves.   Ignore other people's volitional pressure on myself, something like: "Well, that, and I want to." Usually they are - very stubborn children who will do everything in its own way and "put pressure" on them can be difficult in this respect. With age, this is less, but still present. If the first function may not operate objectively, its actions are under attack, you can begin to defend themselves: climb into the fray, attacking someone. Thus a person clears the field for its future activities. If a situation arises where there is no way to continue to live in his pleasure, then we have to somehow make themselves work, strain, to earn more money for it.
</p><p><b>- 2 the function "Do not" - subjective logic.</b> <br />
Usually he likes to tell about the objective laws, the laws of the world. But the question of why so and not otherwise, to answer it can be quite difficult. That is, knowledge is more important than understanding. Understand the need in only a few cases, such as when it becomes your profession. In other cases, you can just take the knowledge and use them for their practical purposes. Not very fond of arguing for an understanding of anything, because usually it does not give any dividends and it often irritates him in others. Well, do not argue, if you do not know this for sure, if you are not an expert in this field. But if the specialist - then, perhaps, there is little sense to discuss this. That is, there is a certain pattern of understanding, when it still needs to be done. And if someone could go into this territory more often that, it will irritate it more often. Not very, it is concerned with questions and understanding with someone, trying to understand someone else only individual and rare   When a situation that is very much "demands". In a situation where for a long time can not be realized in the world for the second function, sometimes minus the second function may displace the second, creating occasions of inversion.   Then they can start to give their understanding, their understanding of the logic of something with a minus sign, to criticize all with these positions. Thus, he begins not only to know how the world works, but also learn to understand it better. Ultimately, this allows him to find it for yourself to work on a second function.  
</p><p><b>- 3 function "Problem Solving" - object ethics.</b> <br />  
To all of you like a circle, their behavior - it is very helpful, and most try to win someone's liking, work on your positive image. Unfortunately, he resorts to this only when love has no one - all gone. In other cases, he prefers his entourage allowed him "to cut a plain truth." Stock up the arsenal of tools that allows you to still hold   people close to you. This may be the ability to sometimes make compliments, knowledge of psychology, the ability to build bridges, politeness. In matters of the third function of the risks should not be, therefore, when it is not sure - sometimes at first gently distributes compliments working on this function, and only then the people he meet the same and he can believe that they are really "good." Thus, the problem of self-protection is successfully solved. It is also much easier to love someone, and if they love you. Therefore, to clarify this issue, too, it is very useful from this viewpoint.
</p><p><b>- 4 function "do not want to, I'm afraid" - subjective intuition. </b> <br />
It does not like to dive, "inward", afraid of this. Even more afraid when someone tries to do it for him. The first thing he would say, "do not climb into the soul." Because of this may seem very   superficial, inconsistent man, devoid of "inner core." Such things as the principles and ideology for him - something too frightening. However, in certain situations, it may consider it acceptable, but very rarely. In other situations, he says that he's all right, even when it is obviously not the case. But admit it - then fear to invade the area. Dislikes undergo massive emotional attack, since it provokes a change in the internal state that it's scary. If the fourth function can not find a comfortable location and you can not leave, it can sometimes be included minus fourth. So there are people who   love begin to pour out his soul to random passengers on the train, like a new place of work "complain to the vest." Thus, he seeks contact with the outer harmony of the world and when someone says to him: "Do not worry, everything is bound to be good", the place becomes at once good and can work again on the fourth function. Once triggered, it can be a good way to give yourself a comfortable place to stay "on the pre-emption." He can first begin to pour out the soul at the first sign that the place may not be comfortable, and only then include a fourth. And even begin to be curious to issues of internal human problems that then it was easier for them to talk.

The main "product" of a highly probable events that can be considered as a negative factor because of its still larger than the standard. The introverted type, which means that he perceives himself to be something separate from the outside world, not something included in it. To itself it seems confusing and complicated, so - quite secretive, he does not like to talk about itself some details.

Dominant requirements relate to functions focused on themselves rather than on the world around it   It allows him easy enough to move from place to place, migrate, adapt to changes in the outside world (the tendency to sanguine temperament - balanced, agile).   It also adds to it an element of self-confidence. The active position in life due to the fact that the dominant need is on the first function. Not very active in the work due to the fact that the subdominant need - in the second. Living in the stream of quantitative information, which means the ability to work well, but not always with good efficiency. He can not see what is going in the wrong direction, to do something for nothing.

<p><b>1 function "good" - the logic of the object. "My life - my rules ... for everyone!" </b><br />
It is very self-confident in its existing knowledge lives by external rules, "routine", "charter", invented by himself, forcing all its vision of "order of things" in the external situation and the conservative in this vision: who should do what, etc. . All things must be in place, moving them gives him a desire to put them in place. Very much the concept of "my territory", "boss", suiting a mess on it irritate people, "Every cricket stick to his last." The existing order of things is immutable, if you ask why it is necessary to do so, but not otherwise - the answers something like "so necessary", without giving a reason. As if living in what they do in the surrounding area hands, so a change in this is seen as an attempt to change themselves. Once having learned certain rule - followed him all his life (2 * 2 = 4). The existing old order has to be changed, if he comes to replace the new - it is already bad. The establishment of order in its place carries the status of self-affirmation. Well versed in the rules anything: to do something - how, and in what order you need to act, where to go, what documents. He knows how to assemble and disassemble anything, self-confident in this, can spend hours messing around with a soldering iron, details, to understand the complex mechanisms. If in my world there are stable and unchanging rules of procedure - that I live. If not - then there is no me. On its territory, always feel the main, do not tolerate objections. If the concept of territory he outlined more widely - it can spread this concept to anyone who is on it. For them, the house - it is an impregnable fortress. If they explain something that they understand - sooner or later they will say "clear" and will interrupt you, as to penetrate to the level of understanding they seek. They are interested in the facts of objective reality - and do not need to understand them, often you just have to remember, learn, compare and implement.   For example: how to assemble and disassemble the vacuum cleaner - do not need to understand, you just have to remember that where inserted. If the facts of its objective picture worlds are changing - then it is irritating, he needs time to rebuild it. The main criterion of activity - the objective benefits that can be obtained. To live with such a person in one territory can be only by its rules, and sometimes their aims to extend and strangers surrounding area as an extension of their borders seems useful work from the point of view of the person that lives and therefore it "exists" in an even greater extent. At least come somewhere in someone else's place and start talking, who is supposed to do - quite typical of him. Communicating with them - it does not leave the impression that he is always in the image of the boss bossy, even if he was not empowered this: "take a shovel, dig the potatoes go now." He does not like those who spend their time wasted, unproductive. He likes to ask again, on what facts established or that the judgment of anyone. The first function of the third: refers to the need to respect their rules for all near and not very good, the environment, since it is in their observance sees pledge of creating external harmony of the world. Therefore, they are always very strictly and meticulously apply to any rules and regulations do not tolerate when someone is late, it violates some instructions. The appearance of a person in their environment, which they ignore, means "double whammy" on it. What he is closer to his personal territory, the greater the stress for the individual.  
</p><p><b>2 function "must" - the subjective sensation. "I know how to cook sandwiches and I will be glad to someone to compete in it."</b> <br />
He is a specialist in physical comfort, sensory pleasures, he likes to deliver his people. He likes cooking, approaches this issue is very creative, though sometimes -   too creative, as often dishes out too specific. Great experimenter in matters of a wide variety of sensory pleasures, loves their maximum diversity.   The proposal to try a rare exotic dish will be seen more often, "with a bang". Often -   good masseurs. Always taking care of loved ones in the physical sense. They know how to create coziness and comfort in some, not intended for this place. Creative and skillful in matters of medicine: if you find that you need to have an operation in the field, they will do it with pleasure without any experience. Generally I like to treat other people and make them healthier body, to conduct experiments on the recovery of the body, to doing it beautiful: hardening, changes in appearance, weight loss. Love also   taste anything: unexpected tastes, smells, physical sensations, and give it to the people all around. Worn all day with offers close "but eat berry", "smell like a flower smells good," "and you want massazhik do?", "Maybe you want a candy with jam?". If someone asks them about some sensory pleasure - it can be difficult to deny, in this context, can sometimes come at a fairly strange territory pleasures simply because someone about something asked. The second function of the third: always concerned about loved ones to the external situation was harmonious. The second of the first and fourth sometimes can act on the principle of "carrot and stick", he indulges in every way those whom he loves.    
</p><p><b>3 function "Problems" - an object of intuition. "How to make sure that life was" raspberry "?" </b><br />
Be careful not to miss anything in life, do not keep up with the possibilities of the outside world. They go all out running,   just to stay in place. Their self-esteem is dependent on the external situation integrity, they are very worried that somewhere in this same integrity is broken: for example, someone in the family had a row - is necessary to run urgently "extinguish" the conflict, all to make peace, even if he has matured and all will better it somehow once "razrulit" that this does not come back. Until recently, they cling to relationships, even   if they have long been exhausted, so as not to destroy the integrity of the external situation. This can completely undermine themselves, but would not destroy Status Quo. If a neighbor has a vegetable garden, then they should immediately make it if   a new film, be sure to see it, to keep up with the world,   They can chase fashion. It's just not the pursuit of external harmony, and the marathon. He likes to be in nature, since it is constant and harmonious at the same time. Dislikes external contradictions,   incomprehensibility of the situation, constantly trying to clear it. It seeks to preserve the constancy of life situation, even where it is clearly not possible. In the case of active protection function - it simply upgraded, constantly adapts to the changes of the world, so that all can continue to remain unchanged for some time and the question of the integrity of the external situation is successfully resolved. When passive protection   man resigns himself to the fact that this is not possible, and let things take their course, falls short of life and recognizes the impossibility of preserving their idea of the perfect world in the surrounding area. Often they love holidays, traditions, as they also do exactly harmonizing function in society:   people are forced to come to terms, to be harmonious with the point of view of the external situation. They want to have it was "like men." His ideals are trying to objectify in the outside world: to create a perfect, fairy-tale world in which all will be well, perfect. To recognize the impossibility of it - means to kill self-esteem, so they often believe in fairy tales, like movies with "happy endami" to survive is a condition where the outer harmony failed. In general, often pay attention to the signs,   horoscopes, tarot cards, often religious: all that can provide at least some possible assistance in building an ideal world, set in motion. Magical worlds can only be built with magical ways.
</p><p><b>4 function "I want to" - subjective ethics. "The love of good, and the darling kid." </b><br />
Seek to find yourself environment, a place where everyone will like them. If someone does not like it - a reason to change the situation. It is very suggestible, if we speak to him as to who should be treated. When you do not know how to treat someone, you feel uncomfortable, they are in need of people who have them explain it all along the way. Looking for a place for himself, where he will be allowed to communicate to all of its assessment, the attitude. If this is allowed - the place becomes a good. In this regard, it is very suspicious, so trying to find and often rely on any objective data. It is estimated to inspire people close to him, who can use it. So, if, having appeared in some new place, there is such a person - that it will try to catch it was his assessment and then to make them their own. For him, the best place where there is a close and trusted friends circle. He likes the situation in which he precisely and unambiguously sure how and what should be treated "black - white". If there is no such clarity - that he felt uncomfortable can. He was always very painful to part with the team, in which he worked, and the memories will bring forth therein nostalgia. It hurts to lose a friend, a comrade, a colleague with whom for a long time spoke. The same applies to personal life. Sometimes deliberately provoke a scandal somewhere as a legitimate way to express their attitude to anything, as the other assessment would require the approval of the team, and this assessment can express so. And then to go to its current estimates, that we can safely speak. If he feels for anyone's feelings - it can all turn a blind eye to all, as it is inspired by love, in his case, it is very blind. It is a feeling that it warms the contrary though any sense. In general, in such a situation the functions develops a very dangerous situation because a person can very easily be programmed to any feelings for anyone, and therefore action. And then simply push to do what he wants. And no hypnosis is not necessary - he will make the best of intentions.  
</p><p><b>- 1 function "Poor" - subjective logic.</b> <br />
It takes into account only the facts, such a thing as their understanding is completely ignored. Because of this, his knowledge can be very good, but too superficial to deep their understanding. This means that to create something based on them new it is difficult. If he is to explain something, sooner or later, he says,   "Understandable" and interrupts you. Dislikes new hypotheses, theories, concepts, since they have not yet checked.   It accepts only something that we can safely refer. Generally does not accept long lengthy discussion of the category of "Is there life on Mars?", Immediately called all windbags. If you tell him that "it is believed that ..." then he'll tear off in mid-sentence, not even giving the finish, "which means there is an opinion? And on what it is based on what evidence? ", Instead of a little think about it. In general, I never get into the theory that he did not need right now in practice. But if you can out of this is something to remove,   then yes, a useful thing. He needs to know the "in fact", and everything else is not interested. This feature means certain narrow-mindedness of thinking, inability to look at the situation from a different perspective.   His logic - not very flexible standard. It can be difficult to understand, say, Castaneda and other philosophers, expanding their horizons of thinking concepts. After all, it's simple and clear:   The earth revolves around the sun, and it is - only one of the possible truths on this subject, to understand can be very difficult. It was known that between two points can be carried out only one line, but came Lobachevsky created their geometry and it becomes clear that this is - also a certain convention. So, no "really" can be all in principle. However, when he defends his knowledge or can not ensure the normal operation of the first function, it may be better to try to understand something, make it easier to "fight" to defend the first function. In life, it also ignores such a thing as mutual understanding with people around them, as if trying not to bother with it, such as to adapt to other people. Also, it does not differ curiously, if   it is not practical knowledge, so it can "sin" a "die-hard".
</p><p><b>- 2 the function "Do not" - object sensation. </b> <br />
Applications for force him allowed only in the most extreme situations. For example, when you were attacked, and then, perhaps, we can sometimes somehow "get out." That is some very rare situations, he raises the norm and deviation from this understanding does not like. Therefore, unwarranted use of force does not accept, and rudeness. Not really likes to strain to go to the goal "in that whatever the cost", to overcome difficulties. During the appearance, but are not to say that makes it very efficient in terms of the ability to create an image. With the money can not handle a lot of fun to spend,   sometimes gets into debt. Earn enough standard techniques to cover their small and not very joy and pleasure. Anyway, it is quite difficult to millionaire to become.   In a situation where there is no possibility of finding "work" in the field of subjective sensory over time - can sometimes begin to criticize the police actions of others, blame the rudeness, brawling, even "dissolve fists." This allows him to shorten the distance with the man, to soften it,   then you can have it and "regret" hug, "prigolubit", say: "Come to me, I do regret a little bit," and the problem of "work" is solved.
</p><p><b>- 3 function "Problem Solving" - subeknaya intuition. </b><br />
If outwardly everything went bad, harmony is not obtained, then the solution of this problem can be searched by the search of harmony interior. Sometimes - in alcohol, sometimes - through "stored" arsenal.   This can be a psychologist or auditory training, meditation, and maybe a girlfriend, which is able to lift the mood. In any case, he resorts to this only in situations when "all bad." AT   others may not think about their inner harmony, instead constantly solving external problems. Well, in general it is clear that we can not all always try to artificially "glue" just stupid "to extinguish the problem," driving them underground, because if they are, it means that we must think of something,   what an idea. If he learns to build on this, and the external problems are solved much easier. Otherwise, they will be stronger only be felt in the future.
</p><p><b>- 4 function "do not want to, I'm afraid" - the object of ethics. </b><br />
Afraid of external relations. This means that he does not like all of these statuses, implying a real relationship: friend, companion, wife, cousin. Can escape from it all somewhere in the taiga, in the mountains for a month - another generally move to another city, so that they ceased to be for this time official, significant for him. Better something like: kind of like a friend, like a friend, like a relative and like his wife. It's easier and to nothing obliges. If someone expresses them clearly their sympathies, they often are afraid of this. It means - just start some kind of relationship with this person, even if he did not reciprocate, that is, it is better to "slip away" somewhere. The best option for them - a relationship without relations. Today, together, tomorrow, not together, the day after tomorrow - together again. commercials   families where the wife always on business trips, are seen on the big holidays. However, in any case, some kind of relationship building is necessary, at least with my parents, family, a small circle of friends. But this is the same reason why he can move to live in another city: there is a reason they enter is not very often.   If he can not find a comfortable location anywhere and you can not leave this place, you can begin to play the fool, to lift all spirits, to behave according to the external situation, to surrounding people also seemed to him a positive response to all this in the necessary positive way. Then it becomes a good location for the fourth function. In other cases, all of these behavioral norms appear to him as something unnecessary and frightening, usually in the office he heads breaks both his home and work hard to make special someone likes to think it beneath his dignity.

But the fact is that since the main function of "product" does not like to be given out in the world, and often holds in itself - then it happens most often when something irritates him in terms of its assessments. That is, the negative is often seen brighter than positive. Hence, such a false impression of these people can be. Trying to challenge their assessment is useless, just something "good", and that something "bad". Explain the reason they will not be able to communicate clearly with the exception of common phrases. He tries to keep himself near those to whom once had positive feelings. They have a very clear division of people into 'good' and 'bad'.   "Good" like, as "bad" despise perfect hatred: often hidden, sometimes openly, especially if the person is very much a strong negative causes. If not enough people around him whom he loves, it could provoke in him the latent aggression, since it means that in this world it is not: after all, no one to love. They are very sensitive to such concepts as duty, honor, dignity, morality, of course - in their understanding. There are important own feelings, emotions and attitude to anything, rather than external, public, which may not be given importance.   Rarely changed his attitude towards anyone. Especially - from bad to good. It has a huge stock of a wide variety of emotions and their nuances. Very sensitive to deviations from their own morality the people around him as if they continually monitors in this regard and looks after. His positive feelings - this is something that from his point of view, you need to constantly validate the behavior that matches his expectations regarding the "good" - "bad." In society, it is too heavy in terms of understanding, because their ethics - personal, subjective, and therefore may deviate significantly from the public despite the fact that the people in it very much deeply "sitting".

The purpose of this human life - to improve, harmonize the world, to build the integrity of the external situation. So sometimes they are quite ruthless to those who would destroy it. Skillful maneuvering capabilities in flow - their horse and they approach this issue very creatively. They know what and how you can improve elsewhere. They know how to make out the situation in the parts and assemble in a more harmonious,   upgraded sound, generators are often bold ideas "bestow happiness of mankind." Look for a place where there is chaos, there to   all adjust. They know how to help a person to understand some complex external problem in an original way, "razrulivat" external conflicts between people to finish something for others, have the talent innovator. Sometimes, however, some business they may unwittingly end up not lead, because then they become unnecessary. Therefore, the perfect world for them - it is a dead world, something to improve it should always be. May often seek to use art as a way to create external harmony, able to create a harmonious atmosphere anywhere. "Storytellers", seeking to create a situation of perfect peace, perfect people.   But that's really living in it does not always fit, often can see the solution to this   "Nesostykovochka" in need "drastic measures" to them.

These questions are the area of self-esteem, so in these matters, they are not afraid to overdo it: winter swimming, training, jogging in the morning, drink specialty products to promote health. Often addicted and alternative medicine, their interest in attracting all that can somehow improve health, they are always talking about it. The slightest danger to him they perceive very boyaznenno: when it's cold - they are the first to notice that an urgent need to dress warmer. Can ask to reduce the speed when someone goes quickly by car. Any threat to health is considered invalid, even taking off screw door of the car is perceived as a potential threat to their lives and refuse to move in a way, always check the equipment, the equipment on the most insignificant occasion, never entrust the "packed your parachute," someone else. If they have any health problems, then this is for them a serious blow to self-esteem. With active protection functions will still seek to prove their physical consistency, to be torn in the front row "into the breach" (say, the first to run on clean-pull of gravity), and passive   They will say: "Yes, I'm old and sick." Anything that can confirm them by their physical consistency,   is it done in the first place. Therefore, they love exercise as a way to prove that they are still "hoo". The worst punishment for them - lie helplessly sick in bed in front of other people. They like to feel safe in medical terms from the organization in which they work. They - of the hostages of the word "useful", especially if it relates to health.

Inspires external order of things, which was at the time   his upbringing: the political system, social norms, etc. Therefore it is extremely sensitive to social change: as long as the order of things has not changed: "God forbid you live in interesting times."   Always moves in the direction of the highest order and places carefully avoids chaos, inspired by the order and very upset that he did not change then. In this connection, sometimes it attracts work in military structures, which has the force of statute. It is important that the situation elsewhere has been organized in accordance with his usual rules and laws do not contradict the facts of objective reality. It is also important to know who and where it should be, what to do. What documents need to collect, for what purpose, where they have to apply and how to fill. Most feel comfortable in a situation of definitive rules of action, without any admixture of subjectivity "in the case of something - to do something-something." Knowledge of the facts is often replaced in a particular situation a true understanding of its problems. Why it becomes superficial, just vault statistics noted by objective laws and regulations. He does not like long and detailed explanations. Immediately interrupts and says, "Well, in short, that there" really? ". There is a view that he wants to get a ready solution, usually, but not its justification. Eg. "2 * 2 = 4" Even rule. Loves terms, sometimes you can just tell them and they they will be enough. He does not like those who are destroying the norms of behavior in some situations, for example, it breaks the chain of command. Particularly inspired by the facts, which sees with his own eyes, if you can touch it. Therefore, it may often become a victim of fraud, which they are able to provide such "fried   facts ", especially if it is clearly (" sleight of hand and no moshenstva ").  
</p><p><b>- 1 function "Poor" - object ethics.</b><br />
Ignore the outside, the real relations between people in order to please their senses and their relation to something. Thus, could easily make enemies. Indeed, in one situation need to behave this way, and in another - some sort. The celebration is not necessary to sort things out, but the wedding is not worth a fuss. But he   I do not see, because this function is pushed out of his mind and all it can do easily. Can   demonstratively ignore external relations, as though not recognizing their importance: "Well, what if the husband and wife, I can see that they look at each other without the sincere feelings." As if every external relations - a complementary attribute of internal relations. Legally married - it's just an external confirmation of these same feelings if they are not, then it - no relation, and fiction. However, sometimes, when they can not work on the first feature comfortable, exposed on it attacks, defend against it or just talking on the themes object of ethics, they can they start to criticize, analyze, working on this function. In the end - begin to see them, at least partially, and to take into account. Then all these points, at least, it does not bear the same trouble as before. The concept of behavioral   norms for them - something very strange, they do not even try to follow them. Completely replace the concept of its assessment of these same standards, resulting sometimes laugh at funerals may become the norm, if you think so (but that, of course, very much exaggerated example).
</p><p><b>- 2 the function "Do not" - subjective intuition.</b><br />  
He has a small set of relevant patterns of internal states, which he tries to fit himself and demand the same from others at the funeral should be upset at the holidays - be in high spirits, etc. Those who do the opposite - are wrong. Ideas and principles for it - is also something that is sometimes, but rarely needed, but as a statement of the form to achieve some goal, rather than on their own. In a situation where a person can not find a job for the second function may begin to criticize the ideas and principles of others, thereby better delves into their internal problems. This allows you to adjust its work to harmonize the external world, to match the real living people, not a "magic man".  
</p><p><b>- 3 function "Problems" - object sensation.</b><br />  
If the "peaceful means" you can not come into contact with health, we have to take drastic measures are tough: hiking in the mountains, winter swimming, martial arts, exhausting diet,   fasting marathons. That is, the worse the health of the more exhausting yourself all of this. If all so good, then all can be limited to collecting hobby medicine and ways to protect against the slightest threat to health. And if there are problems, then people will be more work on the creation of themselves "combat-ready fighting unit." It may begin to perceive your sexual stamina as a way to prove their health and begin to get involved in extreme sports: in fact the person who can be alloyed in the kayak on the mountain river - can not be weak.
</p><p><b>- 4 function "do not want to, I'm afraid" - subjective logic.</b><br />
He does not like long explanations, since they are afraid of him. He does not like to go into some kind of knowledge.   Just I know the fact that "so-and-so." For example, according to statistics 10% of people sitting on the internet at night. But try to understand the meaning of these facts - it is not necessary, it is better, let's figure out how we can use it to their advantage. Because of this, his knowledge is often "sin" superficial, shallow. As if people had read the encyclopedia and it goes everywhere quoted. But dig deeper - do not understand that. He does not know how to put yourself in the other person, not trying to figure it out. In the reasoning of others catches only the facts, statistics, and at the time of interrupting an explanation remarks like:   "No, I do not have to explain anything, just tell me how it really", because he is frightened. It may suddenly find that something he knew not - well, why, it's uncomfortable, scary? And so, without going to the area, you can simply "play" the facts and still benefit from it. After all, you can not argue with them. Also, he does not know how to explain something. Knowledge can shine, but to be able to interpret them correctly - no. Therefore, if it is asked to explain something, help to understand - you may want to escape from there. At the same time, if you run away from uncomfortable place you can not, it can raise these issues. For example, tell a little that he understands. Someone will correct it and unwittingly begins to operate at the same facts, refer to any factual material. Thus, the place will once again be comfortable for him. Can remember the reception and then there is little interest in this even to hint at the fact that the place becomes uncomfortable - again to say something that he understands translating this maneuver the conversation to the facts.
</p><p><b>Summary description:</b><br />
Rational, which means the internal predictability and consistency. External manifestation contrary   very unusual: clothing, work, "product". The first function is related to highly probable events, making it even more conservative and may be considered as a negative factor.   The main "product" is connected with the improbable events, and it can also be considered as a negative factor due to its even greater exaltation. All together it gives the effect of the complexity of understanding with the outside world: inside - too conservative, and outside - is too exalted, his work can be seen by no one recognized. The introverted type, which means that he perceives himself to be something separate from the outside world, not something included in it. To itself it seems confusing and complicated, so - quite secretive, he does not like to talk about itself some details. I am pleased to learn their inner world, and the surrounding   it seems simple and straightforward, so he knows how to safely manipulate it, can take a "command" for themselves. Dominant requirements relate to functions focused on themselves and not on the surrounding world. This allows him easy enough to move from place to place, migrate, adapt to changes in the outside world (the tendency to sanguine temperament - balanced, agile). It also adds to it an element of self-confidence. The active position in life due to the fact that the dominant need is on the first function. Not very active in the work due to the fact that the subdominant need - in the second. Living in a stream of high-quality information, which means the ability to see well the right direction, but to benefit from it are not always due to the inability to work on it. It is very useful to find an assistant who can work,   which would have helped him to achieve the desired objectives.    
</p><p><b>Type signs:</b> frank (overconfidence area), romantic (self zone), eat of (experience zone), the right (the corruption of the zone).<br />
<b>Keys to success:</b> rules, procedures, laws and the facts on the location; health and social protection; pleasing and beloved world; demand for his ability to create harmony in the world.<br />
<b>Career guidance:</b> a peacemaker, music, legislation, optimizer, medicine, interior designer,   teacher, builder, specializing in the field of nature and food, art.
