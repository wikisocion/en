<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Working_conditions"> Working conditions </span></h2>
<p>The incentive for work of LSI is to achieve a high level of prosperity. He qualitatively and reliably performs work assigned to him, hoping at the same time that he will be paid by the merit. Since this type prioritizes concrete returns, it is best to motivate him to work with something tangible e.g. gifts, bonuses, etc. The LSI likes to work at a measured pace. Cannot tolerate jobs that require hurry, urgency, constant changes of plans. When he is rushed and required to rapidly change his course of action, he may flare up with anger. Likes it when he is entrusted with a specific, not very big assignment, such that he will have an opportunity to think it through in advance. Readily masters technological innovations that could facilitate his work. Can be inspired to do work by emotionally charged warnings about dangers and troubles that will follow if he doesn't take action in a timely manner. Dislikes it when someone is interfering with him working, thus lowering the quality of his work. Seeks out environments where he won't be distracted, but can work quietly and independently.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Recommendations_for_self-improvement"> Recommendations for self-improvement </span></h2>
<p>Your strengths lie in being realistic, careful, capable of following through with any project or activity you take upon yourself. You are a responsible person who doesn't throw promises to the wind. You are characterized by a desire for order, discipline, clear rules and regulations. You are impatient of any kind of negligence and irresponsibility. Your thinking is realistic, grounded, guided by objective, concrete factors, not by sentiments. You can perform an in-depth development of specific areas of operations. You are assertive and purposeful. There is no doubt that you make a good administrator. 
</p><p>You also advocate of the use of disciplinary measures against people who are not performing their duties. Do not overdo with applying pressure to others. Try to first understand what constitutes a true instance of misconduct worthy of punishment. You may be too uncompromising in meeting high standards in the home and at work. 
</p><p>One of your main problems - lack of confidence in situations that require breaking the established views without clear prospects, distrust of unexpected ideas and proposals that require rejection of past values. In such cases you may be overtaken by a feeling of impending chaos. Try to abandon old outlived stereotypes after carefully weighing the pros and cons. Keep track of new, unconventional ideas so that they do not catch you by surprise. 
</p><p>Trust people more, don't imagine causes of failures as someone's deliberate machinations. Do not demand same performance out of everyone, remember that everyone has different abilities and talents. Try to develop a more individual approach. 
</p><p>If you are the leader, do not suppress creative initiative in your subordinates or try to monitor their every move. Do not seek to prove yourself by following every regulation and instruction, however obsolete. Extend your range of interests and hobbies, do not focus on one thing. Remember that the most advanced ideas of present times were not recorded in any book in the past. 
</p><p>Your other problem is occasional sharp variations and irregularities in your dealings with people. You display unnatural, abrupt transitions from showing kindness and sensitivity to manifesting authoritativeness. Remember that you have a tendency to show insensitivity and rudeness in close relations. Try to keep a moderately restrained attitude to not escalate possible misunderstandings and conflicts to dramatic resolutions. Do not consider that others are obligated to help you. Do not bore people with redundant moralizing and lecturing. Even if you are right, your didactic tone can make them shun you.
