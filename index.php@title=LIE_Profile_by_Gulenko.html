And if you are also going to assist his endeavors, at the same time keeping him away from overly risky expenditures and actions, your productive interaction is guaranteed.

Unwittingly you can break the relaxed atmosphere of communication, placing yourself and your friends into an awkward position.
</p><p>Your other problem lies in ambiguous humor and jokes that can not always be correctly interpreted and understood. Be tactful and modest in your statements. Do not seek to lift the mood of the people at any cost. Remember that not everyone likes the joking tone, and more so - irony and ridicule. Avoid excessive emotional familiarity in communication. Develop in yourself politeness and good manners. This will boost your self-esteem and instill greater level of respect that others have for you.
</p><p>Don't seek confrontation over issues that are non-existent, unneeded and irrelevant. Through this you can lose respect of many people. Don't show your emotions too quickly. Don't let your actions run ahead of your thoughts. It is better to move away from the object of your irritation, and after some time, when you have clamed down and thought things thoroughly, express your decisions and opinions at the next meeting.
