<p>Willful protection of his own interests (and of interests of his "team"), as well as his own priority - are characteristic of the ESFp (SEE). This is done not for the purpose of direct and merciless suppression, but for maximum freedom of realization of ESFp's own sensing potential, for most complete expression his or her bright individuality, for the realization of his or her own ethical purposes and tasks.
</p><p>Therefore, the assessment of ratio of forces in SEE's value system is based, first of all, on the competition of personal achievements and successes. For the ESFp it is important that his own achievements and merits are acknowledged, and that his authority is accepted as a consequence of realization of his personal qualities: that he is acknowledged as the most sensitive and most thoughtful leader, the most energetic and most active colleague, the most loyal and most reliable friend - the acknowledgement that he is the best and unsurpassed doer of his kind.
</p><p>Irrespective of what occupation or activity he or she chooses, the ESFp sets a goal to be the best of the best. This goal is praiseworthy and deserving of respect in itself, but on other side - how much physical force and resources does it require to live one's life as an on-going sports contest, constantly turning back to compare yourself with your rivals, constantly checking your own successes against others' achievements, constantly being in a state of tension due to the eternal desire to get ahead, to go forward, and to not yield the initiative to anyone else.
</p><p>The ESFp tries to easily and swiftly attain the goals that he or she has set. Getting fully involved in some project or occupation, not considering the efforts spent for achievement of success, the SEE is capable of exceptional fitness for work and of any sacrifices, even those that contradict common sense. (For example, one representative of this type, a beginning singer, has been working on improving her voice by simultaneously visiting three instructors. Unfortunately, the result did not justify the efforts and money she has spent on this.)
</p><p>Not taking into account that he or she may appear to be boasting, the ESFp at every turn "reports" about his or her achievements, sometimes quite sincerely being surprised that others are lagging behind his "model" tempo: "What? You have not yet completed this assignment? I'm already on the next one!" He as if proposes to orient by his own example in any matter. And in fact, why not? The SEE magnificently well knows how to impose the spirit of creative competition and business activity on the most passive and most indifferent to general enthusiasm person - his dual, the INTp (ILI). He can make the most passive and unmotivated person to start hustling around and get more active (The ILIs would have reached extreme points of detachment and passiveness if it wasn't for the exceptional enthusiasm and the hyper-activity of their dual the SEE.)
</p><p>The ESFp negatively judges such traits in people as passiveness, absence of initiative, retreat from the chosen plans. It cannot be said that the SEE openly encourages the ability "to elbow your way through" - it would be more accurate to say that he encourages the ability "to fight, to search, to find, and not to surrender". The ESFp does not respect those who give up before difficulties. He is always for an active position in life and for an active search for solutions. Sometimes the methods that he proposes to resolve some problems appear somewhat linear. It is not that the SEE proposes to go and break through the closed doors (although this is not excluded), but to defend one's rights by any possible method, to attain what has been outlined under any conditions, to do so without fail.
</p><p>For the ESFp it is actually important to know which problems can be solved by method of willful pressuring and which cannot be. Therefore, giving advice to other people, which he himself quite likely wouldn't follow, the SEE does so out of consideration of obtaining information for himself on the important to him ego block elements - where it is possible "to press", and where this is disallowed or ineffective.
</p><p>Similarly, in assessing potential rivals, the ESFp first examines a person's ability to resist pressure that has been exerted on him, and also his or her ability to stand up for himself, and readiness to give an immediate rebuff. Frequently, being confident in his own superiority, or feeling that the situation is "working" in his favor, the SEE can allow himself a "trial falling out" with a person in whose willful potential he is interested. The absence of an immediate rebuff sometimes leads the SEE to an erroneous conclusion that this person is generally not capable of defending him or herself. Sometimes such hastily drawn conclusions in the future put the SEE into some very unpleasant situations.
</p><p>For the ESFp it is extremely unpleasant when he gets publicly "put in his place" - this lowers his self-esteem. Still a more absurd situation is when some unfamiliar person, for incomprehensible reasons, suddenly attacks him. In this case the SEE feels himself to be quite lost. Unfortunately, he is not always capable of quickly taking control of his feelings and calmly and firmly asking for an explanation.
</p><p>The ESFp can vividly, sometimes provocatively "declare" about himself. He can defy society, throw a challenge, create a scandalous image for himself: this for him is nothing more than an expression of his own creative individuality. He is much more disturbed by absence of interest in himself than the consequences of such provocative behavior. He is unsettled by unwillingness to pay attention to his brightly expressed abilities, unwillingness to recognize his success, unwillingness to follow his leadership.
</p><p>The ESFp, first of all, is a person of action. Therefore, he especially painfully relates to any limitations placed on his activities. This is a frequent problem for him, since his activities usually have sufficiently contradictory and turbulent nature that other people seek to curb. ESFp's activity and enterprise usually has a rather large extent and scale of efforts and events.
</p><p>Being exceptionally and at times excessively initiative-taking, the ESFp can literally "break into" other people's lives, into their relationships, due to which he creates an impression of being irreverent, arrogant, and shameless. Quite often the SEE may be unceremonious and imposing.**<br />
[**Translator's note: This may be due to SEE's Ti PoLR, not being mindful of logical basis and hierarchy in relationships.]
</p><p>In his drive to seize initiative at any cost, the ESFp frequently shows himself and behaves not in the best way, due to which he sometimes falls into awkward situations, and sometimes simply ends up looking pitiful or ridiculous. (Of which heaven forbid that anyone tells him!) There is nothing more demoralizing and painful for the SEE than to see that all of his efforts to win over authority, popularity, and positive predisposition, have led to diametrically opposite results. To give the SEE some credit, he or she usually knows how to recognize own mistakes and is capable of publicly admitting to his faults, although possibly this is harder for him to do than for representatives of other types.
</p><p>It would be incorrect to conclude that ESFp's own ambitions are of primary importance to him. What is more upsetting for the ESFp is when other people don't see and don't understand his good intentions. The SEE is completely and sincerely confident in his right to lead. Therefore, non-recognition of his priority and authority is deeply offensive for him, since this means non-recognition of his merits, his honest, selfless, creative labor, to which the SEE usually commits all of his strengths and resources. If for the ESTp (SLE) leadership is a strategic calculation, where any limitations of his ambitions are perceived as a hostile move, then the ESFp, in contrast to the ESTp, fights not for the assertion of his own ambitions, but for the right to justify any trust and confidence that was placed on him. To put it simply, if for the ESFp the feeling of his real authority is important, what is important for the ESFp is voluntary acknowledgement and trust in his leadership. If for SLE it is important to seize, to take authority - for SEE it is important to hold onto and maintain his leadership. The SLE needs authority in order to become the leader of the system, while the SEE needs authority in order to maximally realize his creative ethical potential, to democratize the system led by him, to ethically improve it. If SLE's strategy is to take over all spheres of influence, then for SEE it is important to take "supremacy" in all spheres of his activity: in SEE's opinion, his personal qualities and merits serve to further convince people around him of his right to lead. If the SLE always attentively checks the seized sphere of influence, then SEE often doesn't even notice that he/she took over some sphere or space.
</p><p>(It should be noted that the comparison of "program" functions of SEE and SLE is given as an explanation of fundamental differences between the volitional traits and qualities of these two sociotypes, and not at all to indicate which of them is a "good" leader and which one is the "bad guy" - each of these sociotypes has its own social function, which is necessary for the realization of a specific situation in circumstances of specific societal conditions.)
</p><p>ESFp's actions are distinguished by their swiftness, self-assertiveness, and immediate, all-encompassing initiative. Inconspicuously to himself, the SEE takes over all of the surrounding space. He doesn't always take note of and properly evaluate methods which he uses for winning over sympathies and attention: it is far more important to him to maintain his priority, and for this goal the SEE ready to honestly and ethically work through any obligations that he has taken on himself.
</p><p>One of ESFp's problems is that, in contrast to the ESTp who always knows "how it should be", the ESFp only distinctly knows "how it shouldn't be". With all of his exceptional talents the SEE is more likely to be a destroyer rather than a creator. In politics, the SEE is the destroyer of totalitarian and authoritarian systems. In art, the SEE is a daring innovator who subverts previously existing forms and movements. He could be the founder of a new art direction or movement, which no one else could continue after him in the same form. To imitate him - yes, as much as is desired, but to continue - no. Among representatives of this type there are frequently encountered bright and creative individuals who are gifted and talented in all respects.
</p><p>The contradictory nature of ESFp's volitional sensing "program" lies in the very democratism of his autocracy. The SEE sincerely hates tyranny and despotism; he is one of those people whose name gets written "on the pieces of autocracy" of another leader. At the same time, the SEE tries by all means possible to not yield his influence to someone else. Acknowledging any kind of defeat in this sense is especially agonizing for him. Attempting to hold onto his influence and authority at any cost possible frequently leads the SEE to commit desperate and contradictory actions, that often have tragic consequences for him.
</p>

<p>The ESFp builds any ethical relations from the position of his program function of volitional sensing. That is, it doesn't matter how his relations develop, in any event the SEE must remain the leader. The SEE is deeply convinced that the first and also the last word in the development of relations belongs to him. He is always absolutely confident in his right to check and to control any ethical situation, regardless of the fact whether he has the main or secondary role in it.
</p><p>Despite having relatively strong ethical orientation, despite the fact that "ethics of relations" is SEE's strong creative function, it cannot be said so that SEE's ethical relations develop easily and smoothly. To SEE generally nothing comes easily, because he always and everywhere has to conquer. SEE's problem is that he frequently conquers that which no one else has claimed or disputed. Moreover, he has a habit of conquering that which already rightfully belongs to him.
</p><p>It seems: what prevents the SEE from simply and naturally receiving his natural attractiveness, charm, ease and freedom in making contact? But in this lies the problem - a constant and general acknowledgement of these qualities is needed to the SEE. Additionally, he needs proof that his superiority has been acknowledged, proof of his unquestionable influence. It is precisely in pursuit of these proofs that the SEE tends to lose all of his "majestic" qualities. Sometimes an impression arises that he is asking for compliments, either by force or by inappropriately "pulling" attention to himself, becoming too engrossed in self-love.
</p><p>In the area of ethics, claiming half-victories is not sufficient for the SEE: once he has appeared somewhere, he has to charm everybody, "warm" them up towards himself, interest them, and if needed intrigue them by his person. If there is such a person whom the SEE hasn't interested or positively predisposed towards himself in some manner, it is only because the SEE doesn't take this person into his consideration, for him this person, simply speaking, is an "empty space". 
</p><p>It is not surprising that with such ethics of behavior the SEE manages to gain numerous enemies (independent of the scale of his activity). Moreover, relations of the type friend-enemy are also built with much contrast and inconsistency: yesterday's enemy is graciously received as a friend today, because "this is how it should be", while today's friend, who has given more attention to another subject, is no longer a friend but a "traitor". (The SEE is perhaps the only type in Gamma quadra who divides his contacts into "enemies" and "friends" - the ESI divides people into "his own" and "strangers", while intuitive logical types don't think about this at all.)
</p><p>SEE's ethics is distinguished by certain maximalism because it is subordinate to his "program" volitional sensing (it realizes his base function). It is self-evident that SEE's ethics cannot be consistent: the "realizing" function is always manipulative and always used in service of the "base" function. For SEE his extraverted sensing is the solidly set "program" aspect, while introverted ethics only serves to arrange relationships in accordance with the "program" aspect. Towards those whom SEE respects, and whose consideration he is trying to win over - he has one relation, towards those who are of no value to him - he has another relation. And this forms a problem for SEE, this is the secret of him quickly acquiring enemies and ill-wishers - this mix of ethical inconsistency and maximalism.
</p><p>For how long SEE keeps in the phase of friendship or enmity depends only on the concrete situation. Of course, the SEE won't withdraw until he clarifies everything for himself, that is, he won't step back until he is fully convinced that relations have broken down and he has no chance to correct them. (In SEE's understanding, "to correct" means winning over authority once again. It is unimportant how he does this precisely - begs for forgiveness or starts up a scandal: this is nothing more than means "to straighten" situation by any method possible.)
</p><p>SEE's ethical side is always relative, due to its manipulative changeable nature, despite his strong ethical attitudes. In some situation, the SEE may become fully aware that he is behaving in a bad manner (moreover, he also knows how he should act instead), but he always finds a "convincing" justifications for his own unethical actions. 
</p><p>The SEE always notices unethicalness in behavior of others, but he doesn't always condemn or even mention it. To give SEE credit, he is usually able to relate with humor to the ethical imperfections of other people.
</p><p>The SEE is constantly vying to expanding his sphere of ethical influence. This type may be viewed as a kind of "ethical aggressor". However, SEE's actions within his sphere of influence are often tumultuous, inconsistent, and often unethical in themselves. His ethical tactics, "trusted" persons, enemies-friends, and the centers of his volitional and ethical influences are constantly changing. The SEE is least of all aware that everything that is happening around him is nothing more than a reaction to his own actions. The more the SEE fusses, the more critical the situation becomes, and the more he loses his strategic orientation points within his relationships. In the end, he becomes totally confused as to who is who for him - and now he is engaged in another ethical battle with people close to him, employing some narrow-gauge "shuttle" diplomacy, and some kind of primitive childish intrigues. It seems like no other type knows how to so "creatively" spoil his relations as does the SEE.
</p><p>In any event, no matter how his behavior is evaluated, the SEE sincerely wishes that "everything would be better". He in actuality tries to settle everything so that everyone would be pleased by him, and tries be good for everyone. This position leads to either contradictory actions from SEE's side, or to the absence of any decisive actions, which tends to aggravate his ethical problems.

<p>Program "volitional sensorika" constantly requires information on the aspect "intuition of possibilities". To Caesar it is necessary to most accurately estimate possibilities and abilities of each person, entering the circle of his contact, since its own idea about the success in it is erected relative to potential possibilities and successes of its environment.
</p><p>To Caesar it is always important to know, on what stage of the realization of their plans his surrounding people are located. For example, in the process of studies Caesar constantly is interested, it does not lag behind others in the fulfillment of training targets. Moreover, he always tries to return work to some of the first, he tries to focus attention of instructors on itself, to create the impression of promising specialist about itself.
</p><p>In any situation Caesar is previously interested in positive possibilities. For example, even to the end of studies he tries to explain all possible versions of the distribution of work sites, he searches for for himself some useful business connections, it is interested in the possibilities of other students.
</p><p>For obtaining it the information interesting it develops high activity, time finds to have a talk with each about the plans for the future. In this case he tries to take the locating to the revelation "sincere" tone, confidence lamenting to some its yet not solved problems. Frequently opinions on the question of interest to him are gathered on the threshold of the dynamism, it is advised many, but in the final analysis everything are done in its own way.
</p><p>He tries to produce the impression of man of foresighted and reasonable. Greatly it loves, when it they are advised, share their plans, although it does not always have enough patience to listen collocutor. Sometimes he tries to produce the impression of man, whom everything about all knows, (sometimes even too it hurries to report the information, which he allegedly knows.) It loves to produce the impression of man, who in the course of all events, sometimes can hint, which in it "everything is gripped". Frequently, clearly exaggerating, he speaks about his influence. Away not to fib or "to poblefovat'".
</p><p>For Caesar it is very important from the very beginning of contact to determine the potential of the man: sometimes Caesar evaluates man relative to his subjective abilities, sometimes - relative to the place occupied by it in the society, sometimes - in appearance.
</p><p>On the basis of the approximate estimation of situation and potential of characters Caesar sometimes makes possible for himself sufficiently far to exceed the scope of the permissible ethical standards. The intuition of potential possibilities prompts to it, to whom and as it is possible to relate, who and as itself povedet, who is capable to postoyat' for itself, but who is not.
</p><p>Sometimes Caesar allows for himself the very causing behavior, which in it is called "to speak truth into the eyes". But since the concept about the truth Caesar has its very relative (at least because this is its personal point of view), most precise (from a psychological point of view) explanation to "searches of truth" - this nothing else but desire ethical and intuitively "to probe" situation. The desire to learn, will descend to it from the hands that that it now makes, and as they will react to this "truth into the eyes".
</p><p>Caesar will not carry uncertainty. Therefore sometimes he specially accelerates the crisis of situation in order to make a new arrangement of forces in it and to understand its place in relation system. To understand, who there is who, as him they receive and after whom "him hold".
</p><p>To the happiness for itself (and its duala of Balzac), under the conditions of the uncertainty of relations Caesar is not always locked on one partner during this period it it can open for itself the "second front". Subconsiously that disposed to the vulnerable ethics of the emotions of Balzac, Caesar is scared to explain those relations, which it especially values, it fears emotionally "to press" to the partner. Therefore for redistributing the superfluous emotional activity to it is necessary its kind the "fallback position", which it distracts and it makes that with less dependent on the "basic version."
</p><p>The tactics of the "second front" forces Caesar to deceive by cunning, to use cunning, to be twisted out from the awkward situations, but it entire this does not love - to it this is inconvenient: this degrades its merit, it contradicts its ethical principles, the main things from which - decency, honesty and devotion. Furthermore, the weak intuition of the possibilities for it of this does not allow: it always fears conviction in the lie, fears, which will involuntarily give out itself, which will let out a secret, that this will become some means known to its partner. And nevertheless, since it is not always capable to consecutively relations with all its partners, the uncertainty of situation frequently forces it to maneuver between them - it simply does not see for itself another output.
</p><p>The analysis of the possibilities of situation in Caesar frequently is too surface or too optimistic, since it assembles information not of the very authoritative sources and evaluates by its not most critical means. For example, many representatives of this type unconditionally believe to the media, even if those extend completely improbable rumors.
</p><p>Sometimes Caesar develops the role of person, who confidently looks in the future, vidyashchego for himself and for others the mass of possibilities. Frequently he and itself in this case is inspired and tries to inspire those surrounding. However, after encountering with the first real, objective obstacles, about his "enthusiasm" he forgets in the manner that as if it and not it was never. Then the feverish search for possible output from the difficult situation already begins.
</p><p>Error on the aspect of the "intuition of possibilities" bypasses Caesar very dearly: at best - these are the separate unpleasant situations, into which it risks to fall, in the worse - this is the crash of entire its quarries. Therefore Caesar greatly tries not to make anything such, which subsequently would be wrapped up against it. And although it never is to the end confident in its intuition, nevertheless it attempts it to constantly develop in order to have the capability to error-free on it rely.
</p><p>The most complete aid on this aspect Caesar nevertheless obtains from his duala of Balzac, who not only knows how to foresee the most unfavorable course of events, but also it can in the soft and delicate form warn against possible troubles. But the method to avoid them at the same time and will prompt.

<p>To Caesar it is difficult to be objective, since it find in the captivity of its ethical installations, its sympathies and antipathies.
</p><p>Its behavior can contradict the common sense at least because most frequently they reflect its emotional relation to proceeding.
</p><p>Sometimes in Caesar kak's behavior displaces the logical significance of his behavior, i.e. it enters in spite of the common sense, being based to some primitive logical stereotypes only because "it is so accepted to act". Moreover, being guided by its logical stereotypes, it frequently acts to the detriment of its ethical principles: for example, it destroys the prevailing good relations with its close ones only because it reacts in the manner that it is accepted logically, on the general concepts, but not in the manner that he this feels ethical: let us say, it scolds for first, for which it is necessary (in the conventional, stereotype understanding) to scold, it praises for that, for which it is necessary to praise.
</p><p>Sometimes this is expressed in the habit to use surface logical (and ethical) stereotypes, to act in accordance with these slogans and to utter them apropos and without the occasion: "pity degrades man", "they fear - it means they respect", "it is jealous - it means it loves", "where postelil, there and sleep", "woman must not display initiative", etc.
</p><p>Sometimes these are the logically displaced intonations and accents in the speech. Sometimes this is the ethical unjustified mimicry.
</p><p>Sometimes these are the displaced or unstable interests in the received information. For example: listening to explanations, Caesar frequently is distracted from the basic idea, him suddenly they begin to interest some completely secondary moments or unessential details. It is unnoticeable for itself, it moves away from basic theme or distracts by questions of secondary significance. Or by the questions, which do not completely refer to the discussed object.
</p><p>One additional characteristic for the representatives of this type the feature: ability apropos and without the occasion to be distracted from the assigned theme to the conversations about itself. (obvious case - Pushkin's lyric retreats in the "Yevgeny Onegin".)
</p><p>To be occupied by the classification of concepts or knowledge, to put them into the ordered system - for Caesar dull and mutornaya work. To it it is difficult to be concentrated at the logical analysis of any phenomenon, it is difficult to be concentrated for the sequential understanding of logical conclusions, it is difficult to very to present anything consecutively: it can begin explanation directly from the middle and continue it, constantly returning to the initial and intermediate stages. Thus, in the account of Caesar some even simple explanations are very intricate.
</p><p>The superficiality of ideas about its many phenomena does not confuse - it considers this natural ("we everything they learned gradually anything and somehow") the main thing so that the discussed object would be although otdalenno, with sign, it is not possible to produce the impression of complete incompetence.
</p><p>It is very careful in the statements, which are concerned the lawful or technical aspect of the matter, it does not risk to seem by nonobjective or incompetent
</p><p>It does not love to study instruction and rule - to it this is boring. (representative of this type it can repeatedly burn through electric appliance, including it, without having become acquainted with the instruction it is known the case of "unsuccessful" cleaning of the memory of computer, after which proved to be effaced all placed in it programs) I no matter how was sad its personal experience, nevertheless to Caesar difficult to change themselves, and it frequently relies not on the instruction, in which it is rare and little which understands, but to the success, the luck and to its intuition despite the fact that it fairly often brings it.
</p><p>The experience of strange errors also always does not produce on it a sufficient impression Caesar it can as much as desired confer and consult, but in the final analysis he will enter in its own way, despite all councils and common sense. Caesar distinguishes the exceptional ability constantly "to fill lumps" at one and the same place. Deeply to suffer, to suffer and to ask in all and each, why this every time occurs precisely with it, and what deficiencies it should in itself eliminate so that these misfortunes finally would cease they be required colossal patience and endurance (qualities, inherent in its dualu to Balzac) in order to train Caesar to analyze the experience of past errors, i.e. the very thing, what Caesar, in spite of the desire of those surrounding, to make decisively rejects (and you do not request, and do not persuade!) It entered and enters only, as it will deem necessary to it, but otherwise it simply cannot be itself itself.
</p><p>For Caesar the need for thoroughly thinking over its behavior, behaving prudently presents serious problem and it is reasonable. Observations in the illogicality of its own actions it does not transfer the requirement to be sequential in its actions is derived it from itself. For it to characteristically act wisely and logically only until this from it they require, until they respect it also they are considered it. But it is worthwhile to only accentuate attention in its illogicality, as all its actions immediately they cease logically to be checked and acquire the nature of disorderly, panicky fuss.
</p><p>The charges of Caesar in the illogicality only aggravate his problems. Itself Caesar very painfully transfers any criticism in his address, and since requirements for themselves in it are sufficiently overstated, to it it is difficult to recognize with the presence of all its merits this deficiency as faulty logic. Caesar it generally is desirable to be man without the deficiencies. (A whom of this it does not want?) Therefore Caesar greatly survives, when they give low estimation to his mental abilities. To it it is very difficult to allow itself not to be cleverest (although this is better, that it can for itself make).
</p><p>It must be noted that to Caesar to more easily be sequential and logical in its behavior after it was dismantled at the possibilities of situation (sequence of the work of function). For Caesar to enter reasonably - this means to enter wisely, i.e. it is farsighted, it is foresighted. The more thorough it will be informed on the aspect "intuition of possibilities", the easier to it to enter logically produmanno.
</p><p>In a word, so that in behavior of Caesar there would be less than contradictions and fuss, it is necessary to place him in the specific psychological regime, in which it will obtain a sufficient information by intuition of the possibilities, support by intuition of time and that is very important, the absence of criticism on the aspect of the logic of relationships. I.e., the psychological support of Balzac is necessary for Caesar. Its skill to show the prospects for situation in such form that they would not frighten and would not plunge Caesar into panic, to show the possible reserve of time in order to distract it from the fuss and to create it conditions for the thorough logical analysis. Balzac knows how to find the simplest and most accessible to understanding forms explanation. He is very methodical in his explanations, he knows how to illustrate by their successful examples. It knows how to bring collocutor to the necessary logical conclusion, letting it very be glad at its own discovery.

<p>The SEE does not hide his problems on this aspect. How can he hide them when it becomes obvious that with all of his exceptional activity the SEE never has enough time. And where is he going to get it, when he starts several matters and undertakings simultaneously, each requiring high expenditures of time and effort.
</p><p>An attempt to concentrate on what he should do now and how long it will take put the SEE into a lot of tension. Thus he  generally prefers to not think about such things: the SEE does what he wants at the moment, and spends as much time as this activity requires. The SEE tries to work quickly and prefers not to get stuck on any step in order to have time to do as much as possible - he tries to not complicate work for himself. If some ambiguity or uncertainty appears, the SEE switches to another matter. Main thing for him - is to always advance, always move forward, not getting fixated or stuck on a specific problem.
</p><p>Getting absorbed into the process of work, the SEE frequently doesn't notice its pointlessness and lack of prospects. Thus he sometimes feels afraid to think about what will happen in the future, what will transpire next. It is easier for the SEE to live by the present day, not thinking and worrying about the future. If he does think about it, the SEE prefers to see in his future only that which he wishes for himself. Any information about potential problems and setbacks he receives very unwillingly, despite being aware of its importance. For his light-mindedness the SEE sometimes pays dearly. 
</p><p>The SEE dislikes waiting. This for him is incredibly difficult - he is too active and therefore too impatient. He wants everything, at once, or at least sooner rather than later. It happens that he has no time to think, or simply doesn't want to waste his time on contemplation and reflection. His dual, the ILI, creates a more measured pace of life for the SEE and teaches him to live by the principle "hurry unhurriedly". He cools the exorbitant fervor of SEE and calms him down: "time will give an answer to all questions", "time will put everything in its place". The SEE listens to such advice and becomes convinced by it. Suddenly he develops a wish (and sometimes a curiosity) to patiently observe and "see to the end" how it will all happen.
</p><p>Sometimes the SEE reflects on the topic of whether he or she is living "correctly" or "incorrectly". How will his present day behavior reflect on his future fate, and what he should change now so that in the future everything comes together for him in the best way possible. In themselves, such reflections are very tiresome even agonizing for the SEE. Therefore he prefers to obtain already compiled information on this aspect in advance. Sometimes the SEE feels a wish "to introduce order" to his present life in order to ensure for himself a better future. Then it becomes necessary to analize the consequences of each of his steps and actions. For the SEE it is important to know what will occur after he takes this or that step or another. (The SEE actually needs the instruction: "If you go to the right - you will lose your horse **...")<br />
[**Editor's note: This quote is from Russian folk tales, where a traveling hero encounters a three-way road with an inscription that warns him of different consequences of taking each path. The hero then decides for himself which road he must take. Stratiyevkaya has compared SEE's dual the ILI to such an inscription tablet.]
</p><p>By nature itself the SEE is granted such dual as Balzac. No one better than him knows how to predict future outcome of events depending on various circumstances. It is only necessary to tell Balzac "what has happened", and "what will follow and calm and quiet the heart" he will describe himself.
</p><p>From Balzac Caesar can obtain precise information about the opportuneness and expediency of any of his undertakings, and a general idea about the consequences of his actions, see the reflection of his today's behavior in the near and distant future. Such information for SEE is always valuable and relevant, while the ILI has no equals in this respect. The SEE can be reasonable, farsighted, and prudent only with the timely warnings and the forecasts of his dual ILI.

<p>The SEE - is a person of exceptional business activity and fitness for work. He or she is exceptionally hardy and diligent. Takes up any work with readiness without considering the expenditures of time and effort. If the circumstances require it, he'll take up hard physical labor associated with dangers and the difficulties.
</p><p>For the SEE, as for any representative of third quadra, it is very important to realize his creative potential and to see that there is a need and demand for his work. Therefore the SEE gets very activated when he undertakes some concretely feasible assignment or task. And the more he knows how to realize and fulfill it - the more enthusiasm and energy he demonstrates.
</p><p>The SEE frequently produces the impression of person who knows how to do everything. He or she sufficiently quickly masters new specialties, professions, skills - more accurately, new crafts and know-hows.** Moreover, that which he has once mastered does not become forgotten. The SEE actively uses his many-sided "arsenal" of abilities and talents, and usually easily finds possibilities to make additional income or earn money on the side. The SEE "sows, and reaps, and plays the flute in the meantime". Whichever work he undertakes, he does everything quickly and easily, as if he's playing.<br />
[**Editor's note: This is more accurate for SEEs and IEEs of Se or Ne subtype who have accentuated activating function, and are thus more oriented at learning new methods on their "hidden agenda" than the ethical subtypes.]
</p><p>The SEE gets into the process of work very eagerly, since this process is much more attractive to him than preparations. Talking about some future task or project that he wants to realize, the SEE mentions possible options and courses of action in hopes that somebody else will pick out the best, most promising course, and undertake its realization, but once the SEE is already working he prefers not to think about about different possibilities: he develops the option that has first come to his mind.
</p><p>The SEE is very sensitive towards criticism of his errors and mistakes, but he is happy if his work differs in some significant and favorable way from the work of others. The SEE also dislikes thoroughly checking the results of his work and prefers if a reliable and competent partner would verify and check it, calm him down, and offer some useful observations. The need to slowly work through every detail suppresses and annoys him. Sometimes the SEE doesn't apply enough time and effort to study theoretical material - he decides that he will figure things out in the process of work and application, and in parallel ask for advice at every stage that causes his difficulties. He is interested in receiving essential and situation-pertinent advice. With much attention listens to commentary about rational fulfillment of his tasks, but very much dislikes it if the end result gets criticized. Finds it easier to work by his own precisely developed and remembered methods and techniques. 
</p><p>In everyday life, the SEE usually manages his household in a rational manner. With interest listens to information concerning ways of successfully investing money or making advantageous acquisitions. In such matters, there is no more valuable consultant for him than his dual, the ILI, who can warn the SEE about poor and untimely investments and waste of money, and not allow him to get involved in risky projects - the ILI talks the SEE out of pursuing get rich quick schemes that are often of questionable nature. 
</p><p>From ILI the SEE receives precise information on every question: what needs to be done, when, in which order or sequence, and whether there is a point in doing it at all. On basis of this information the SEE acquires confidence in correctness and appropriateness of his actions, a sense of calmness and order in his life, as well as a certainty that his own strengths and energies are being applied rationally and purposefully.

<p>The ESFp will never will allow himself or herself to look worse than others. He/she usually know how to present himself or herself effectively, although the SEE is sufficiently nitpikcy and critical about own looks and outward appearance.
</p><p>Independently of the level of his income, the ESFp dresses with taste. Frequently people of this type have their own, personal, sometimes sufficiently extravagant style, which the SEE may not completely like in the depths of his or her soul and may not find it completely agreeable, but that the SEE considers to be necessary to adhere to in order to draw and command attention. The ESFp strives to positively distinguish himself or herself from other people by external appearance: he/she considers the brightness of own appearance to be an indispensable condition of own success.
</p><p>The ESFp views basic comfort and common convenience to be an indispensable condition of normal life. In organization of his own way of life, the SEE is often guided primarily by the requirements of optimumal conveniences. The SEE approaches setting up his or her own way of life without any excessive snobbery: cleanliness, comfort, convenience - these are his main aesthetical criteria. And of course, everything in his house must be no worse than in the houses of others.
</p><p>Aesthetics for ESFp - is the sphere of realization of many of his or her talents and abilities. The SEE typically has very specific, clear-cut aesthetical criteria in which he or she is confident, although others may question and criticize them. Aesthetically the SEE is also always logical - his artistic style always comes with a justification. If the SEE is ever extravagant, for him or her this is no more than a method of creative self-expression.
</p><p>Art is a field where creative successes of ESFp are most noticeable and find the brightest and complete expression. Here, the SEE strives most of all to excellence and precision in work, and it is exactly here that SEE's efforts and craftsmanship deservedly obtain appreciation.
[Editor's note: An example of this, one ESFp woman started working as a regular hairdresser in a beauty salon. Due to her precision and meticulousness with giving haircuts, over the years she has gained many regular customers who recommended her to their friends, and her business prospered.]
</p><p>The ESFp is also characterized by high physical activity and endurance. The SEE typically doesn't pay or draw attention to the problems of his well-being, inner states, and health. For leisure and vacation time, the SEE prefers an active and saturated by impressions lifestyle.
</p><p>The ESFp is very life-loving. His love and appreciation of life in a surplus is sufficient enough both for him and for dual the INTp (ILI, "Balzac"). Under no circumstances does the SEE completely lose his natural optimism and taste for life.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="8th_Function_-_Fe_Extraverted_ethics"> 8th Function - Fe <a href="index.php@title=Extroverted_ethics.html" title="Extroverted ethics"><img alt="Fe" src="images/2/20/Symbol_e.gif" width="12" height="12" /></a> <a href="index.php@title=Extraverted_ethics.html" title="Extraverted ethics" class="mw-redirect">Extraverted ethics</a> </span></h3>
<p>ESFps emotions subconsiously shape his flexible, manipulative ethics of relations (Fi) i.e. exactly those emotions are expressed that in opinion of the SEE a given situation requires.
</p><p>For this very reason the ESFp often expresses the necessary and congruent to the situation (again, in his opinion) emotions in the relation to the events. If there is a holiday or a celebration, which means everyone needs to be cheerful, the SEE will be the first to try to raise the overall mood. (Although the SEE doesn't always view himself obligated to take on the role of mass organizer-joker.) If some problem arises, this means jokes are put to the side, and, with characteristic of him emotional pressure, the SEE will try to accelerate its resolution.
</p><p>The ESFp knows how to solve his problems by means of emotional influencing magnificently well (as any ethical type). But since the extent of his influence is formulated subconsiously with an orientation to the problematic emotionalism of INTp (ILI, "Balzac"), the emotional activity of SEE is usually not too serious, and not excessively dramatic. Rather it is a kind of ethical game that gives the necessary emotional impulse at the given moment.
</p><p>The ESFp considers himself to be a sufficiently strong person capable of managing his own problems. Therefore, his emotional influence on a partner is not a signal of an extreme or dire situation (as, for example, for ESFj "Hugo") - this is only a form of his emotional manipulation of the partner: from one side - to recharge himself, from another - to wind up and active his partner. (Since his dual INTp "Balzac" emotionally activated very heavily.)
</p><p>The emotions of ESFp (especially at the young age) are characterized by certain "childlike exaggeration". Frequently, their expression is preceded by enthusiastic or frightened exclamations. Sometimes the SEE uses emotional flow in the cases of impossibility of thoroughly explaining anything: "Ah, how can you do this!? Oy, how do you not understand!? Well, what is this!"
</p><p>In mature age, the emotions of ESFp become further subordinated to the system of his or her relations and are rarely used at a method for SEE's independent expression of his or her moods and feelings. In any case, life experience (and also successful dualization) teach the ESFp to be more careful and restrained in expressing his or her emotions.
</p><p>Interaction with an INTp (ILI, "Balzac"), who knows how to extinguish superfluous (unjustified) ardency, goes to benefit the ESFp - ESFp's emotional infantilism, which prevents him/her from appearing truly majestic, begins to vanish.
</p><p>Emotional restraint cultivated by the ILI serves to ennoble the SEE. It serves to endow SEE's statements and behavior with special significance and rationality, which, in turn, beneficially contributes to SEE's personal effectiveness and authority.
