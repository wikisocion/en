</p><p><b>Problem areas</b> <br /> 
SEI finds it difficult to be involved in pressing, stressful business activity, to be active, mobile, and dynamic for prolonged periods of time. At times he is lax and disorganized. Secretive and vulnerable. Can show obvious discontent if someone disturbs his state. At such moments can be indignant, respond harshly.

</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="As_a_supervisor"> As a supervisor </span></h2>
<p>A person of this type is usually sociable, amiably predisposed towards others, shows sincere interest in people who respond to him with reciprocity, feels the need to help others.
</p><p>Supervisor-diplomat<br />
A diplomat should be able to capture the smallest nuances of people's interactions, take note of small parts and details that could affect the course of events and use them to build friendly, cooperative relations. "Mediator" is the type of leader who relies on his superior knowledge of the situation. He is always aware of information that circulates in his social circle, and therefore he most often knows whom and how to influence. Sensitively reacts to anything that can prove to be useful later. Prefer to resolve many problems on an informal basis. To accomplish this, he arranges confidential meeting within the circle of his trusted associates. In this manner he compensates for his inability to manage the situation by purely administrative methods.
</p><p>The aim to solve many complicated problems informally is the core line of conduct and organizing principle of SEI's interaction with colleagues and subordinates. He prefers to interact with his colleagues on basis of trust; without this he feels uncomfortable*. Emotionally dependent. His emotions are associated with altruistic and communicative needs. In accordance with this disposition, SEI tries to act by methods of persuasion. He sees harmonization of relations in the team as his goal.
[translator's note: communication style of all of the IxFx types are is characterized as "sincere/soulful": link]
</p><p>Works well in conditions where there is no rush, where nothing violates the rhythm of life. Supervisor-diplomat avoids risky undertakings and displays of business activity - he is not eager for power and does not abuse it. This is due to the fact that his own interests go far beyond the scope of professional activities. This sociotype feels his value not only in relation to work and pragmatic activity, but also far outside of its bounds.
</p><p>Any conflict for "Mediator" is a source of stress, even if he was not its instigator. In a conflict situation, he is prepared to yield first and accept a compromise. Often, such a concession is made even if it is detrimental to the objective interests of the group of interests of people of the group. As a result, he may lose the respect of others of his collective*.
[translator's note: this part of the description is hinting at "democratic" inclinations of this sociotype i.e. acting independently of the common cause]
</p><p>A characteristic feature of the sociotype "Mediator" in a supervisory position is the desire to improve the morale of the group, to foster the development of personal relations within it, to create a sense of belonging in each member of the organization as a whole. This style is most suitable for managing a group whose members already possess the basic skills and necessary qualifications, and approach their work responsibly and with discipline. In this case, an important function is to ensure that the psychological climate in the group remains favorable for efficient operation.
</p><p>Main characteristics:
</p>
<ul><li> Can adequately show himself in the role of the frontal, emotional leader.
</li><li> Method of establishing contacts is focused on personal factors.
</li><li> Business activity is expressed in judiciousness, prevention of risky steps.

</li><li> Strategy: assumes the responsibilities of a leader in dealing with and resolving ethical issues.
</li></ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Working_conditions"> Working conditions </span></h2>
<p>The impetus for SEI is welfare, that is, an opportunity to live "not worse than others", to create a comfortable atmosphere at home with the money that he makes. Material well-being gives him a sense of stability and confidence in tomorrow. Therefore, you should never entrust him with work for which you won't be able to pay when it's due. He doesn't care for rank and titles; he doesn't want to burden himself with excessive responsibility. 
</p><p>Calm, even routine work, which he can complete with ease and even creatively, and for which will earn what is due - this is ideal for the "Mediator". Since SEI is a type that thinks concretely, good working conditions, where his workplace is well equipped and comfortable, are important for him. He himself will take care of this, just don't stand in his way. The SEI can't always tell what, when, and in which sequence should be done. Therefore, you will have to look over these aspects of his activities and the timetable. And also, see to it that he doesn't ignore the uninteresting but nevertheless important parts of work (most often these are preliminary consultations and examination of the project, as well operations that require a lot of effort.) It is better if you do these parts yourself or assign someone more suitable to carry them out.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Recommendations_for_self-improvement"> Recommendations for self-improvement </span></h2>
<p>Your strong point is the ability to select for activities and occupations that you truly enjoy, which bring joy, enjoyment and pleasant experiences. You are irreplaceable for organization of leisure and relaxation with friends. Delicious food, beautiful tableware, interior design, as well as a warm, relaxed atmosphere of communication - this is where you show yourself creatively. You know how to derive joy from life and how to share it with others. You prefer a beautiful natural landscape that resonates with internal state of your soul to more active ways of spending your time.
</p><p>You are generally a diplomatic and agreeable person. Therefore, you are able to avoid arguments and conflicts. You are tolerant of other people's shortcomings, gentle and responsive in communication, you dislike applying crude pressure on anyone. Your behavior evokes pleasant emotions in others. You possess a good sense of humor, cheerful, easy-going disposition. You know how to take a growing conflict and turn it into a joke.
</p><p>Your main problem—lack of consistent performance, inability and unwillingness to force yourself to do uninteresting, difficult, but necessary work. You dislike formal settings, prefer to negotiate with others privately, relying on tried and tested contacts. Develop in yourself a more proactive attitude towards life. Refer to the saying: "Business first, pleasure afterwards".
</p><p>Concern and think more about the interests of other people, help them with deeds and not words. Ensure that your personal interests coincide with the interests of the common cause.
</p><p>Try to overcome inertia in yourself. Don't hesitate to spend some of your efforts on doing socially beneficial things that do not promise immediate returns or benefits to you specifically. Then people will develop more respect for you and view you as an trustworthy partner.
</p><p>Another one of your problems—insufficient farsightedness. You cannot always properly evaluate distant, future prospects of present moment undertakings, such that you often end up "sitting on the fence" and waiting, focusing only immediate, guaranteed returns. In such cases, you risk to win in small things but miss out on larger, more substantial chances and opportunities.
</p><p>Be careful when giving promises—don't offer something you wish for as something you can actually do. Don't overestimate the potential of your projects, don't try to excessively advertise and praise them, or others won't consider you to be a serious person. Be consistent in your decisions, plan more regularly, don't limit yourself by your instincts and improvisation. Bring started tasks and projects to their completion so as not to let down yourself and others.
