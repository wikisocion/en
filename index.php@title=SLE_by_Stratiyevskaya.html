<p>"The strong are listened to even when they speak in whisper" — Alexander Lebed. Strength, power, purposefulness, determination and perseverance – these are the main "program" values of representatives of this type. For this reason they excel at evaluating the strength and "volitional capabilities" of each person. They pay special attention to people who aspire to power and try to never concede "volitional initiatives" to others. 
</p><p>The main reference point that occupies the attention of ESTp "Zhukov" is the distribution of forces and powers within an existing social structure and his own capabilities. To put it another way, for the entire duration of their lives, regardless of their occupation and interests, consciously or unconsciously, members of this type are constantly posing before themselves a question: "Who will overcome whom?". The entirety of SLE's "volitional sensing" is viewed under the aspect of: "Either I overcome them, or they will overcome me." ("When I was little my father would subordinate me, now that I've grown up I subordinate him.") 
</p><p>Being able to sense own physical strength and power, own ability and authority, is of significance to the SLE. He respects capability and influence, and will respect any hierarchical system that is founded on the "right", in his view, balance of power. The SLE typically ties to find a position for himself or herself within an already existing system. This is the first step in all of his or her endeavors, the "minimal program", the primary goal. 
</p><p>ESTp's "volitional program" consists of consecutive achievements of short-range goals by all means possible. ("The end justifies the means.") The end goal of Zhukov is to obtain a leading position within the hierarchy. It does not matter who he or she is today - the head of a government department or the leader of an opposition group: the ESTp always feels him/herself a person of power and authority. Within his field or area of that was entrusted to him or her, the SLE is invulnerable, has unquestioned authority, is the "God and King". Even if Zhukov works in a department as a regular employee, setting "higher" goals ahead of him/herself, the SLE can in a short period of time subordinate the management (which sometimes works out better for him than heading the department himself). 
</p><p>Organization of power structures and leadership within them – is one of the social functions of representatives of this type. The insertion into a system and the search for like-minded people within it, the insertion into spheres of influence and important business interests, followed by introduction of "his people" whose activities he will oversee, coordinate, and who will obey him at the right moments - all this leads to the creation of ESTp's own substructure within an already existing system: a sequential step-by-step takeover of power by the method of a "gradually compressing iron ring". 
</p><p>ESTp does not waste time on trying to reach extraneous goals that do not lead to his or her final goal. Moreover, the ESTp doesn't let him or herself to get confused and disoriented, and thrown off the course. (For example, an opposition movement will interest the SLE <i>only if</i> it has an actual chance of growing and gaining influence, if the SLE sees in it a real and solid opportunity to earn "political capital" or a consequential possibility of becoming the leader of the opposition.) 
</p><p>The position of an "errand boy" is unacceptable to the ESTp – this he or she tries to avoid by all means. The SLE finds it difficult to ask anyone for help or favor: he or she feels that this is somehow humiliating. For this reason the ESTp tries to build the situation in such a manner that others will have to do what he needs them to (the method of the "iron ring" in a miniature version). 
</p><p>Unthinkable for the ESTp is a situation where he's taken for a dupe – this is more than just a blow to his ego: it's the collapse of his whole "program". Often an impression arises that the SLE is obsesses with the notion of "respect-disrespect". Constantly and everywhere he requires recognition of his own priority (which in itself already signals an underlying lack of confidence in himself). The more an SLE feels himself "subservient" on the inside – the more attention and respect he will outwardly demand from others. 
</p><p>The ESTp dislikes being dependent. Dependence for him is a sign of weakness, while the ability to make others depend on you – is a sign of power. (He likes to offer his "valuable" services, likes to be "needed" by others, and can also "remember" the favor and ask for a repayment.)
</p><p>SLE's wish to expand the extent of his influence is dictated not only by unfulfilled ambition, but also an internal need to ensure that he won't be put into a situation of forced submission. ("Either I make him submit, or he will submit me.") Throughout his life, the SLE seems to be accumulating additional "margin of safety". He does not simply "advance for no reason" but tries to capture a little more "for the future". In this case if he's made to surrender something, it won't be as disappointing: he might have to give in and give it up, but it won't be what truly belonged to him. A quality that is widespread in representatives of this type: taking over administrative, physical, and, most importantly, territorial advantages. 
</p><p>The conquest of space for the ESTp is a task of paramount importance. It is realized by people of this type in the most natural and therefore not always fully conscious way. Even if it is a simple capture of extra space in a communal kitchen or extra meters in the backyard, the SLE will feel dissatisfied if the initiative came from somebody else. For representatives of this type taking up space is the most natural state. (Often, without knowing it, Zhukov chooses a central position in available to him space – he can, for example, move himself to the middle of a room and feel well talking to people who are sitting along the walls.) 
</p><p>Sometimes the SLE prepares an "area of action" for himself quite deliberately. For example, having decided to go explore another city or another country, he will gather requests from his friends, which gives him the opportunity to visit their friends and relatives, to ask them about life there and the times, to tell about himself, to make new acquaintances, to get a place to live for a day or two, and before you know he's accepted as one of their own, and the next time he pays a visit as if he's visiting his own friends.
</p><p>In everyday life the SLE often wins space over with noise and sounds. For a child-Zhukov it is characteristic to shout replies to his parents across the entire yard - at this moment a child of this type feels that he/she owns all of the surrounding space. For Zhukov who has moved to a new place (especially residents of southern countries) it is very characteristic to put on some music at full volume as soon as they arrive, and to leave the door to his house or apartment wide open, so that the neighbors have no illusions about who is the boss here. For the same reason, some SLEs don't like having neighbors who play music loudly and may petition for their eviction. 
</p><p>ESTp's distribution of power is always very primitive: "either-or" - there is no alternative. This is because the SLE is always focused on close-range goals – either he takes it, or he doesn't. ("Either you succeed or you fail.") By and large, SLE's entire system of relations is subject to this: "either a leader – or a servant", "either the owner - or a nobody". In SLE's system, the balance of power has only two poles: the strong and the weak. While the SLE prefers to be in a strong pole, if he has found himself defeated, he is capable of admitting it and submitting to the winning side.
</p><p>The ESTp is distinguished by an exceptional capacity for work and drive, which grows proportionally to the number of obstacles that he or she faces. 
</p><p>The SLE does not allow anyone to doubt his ability and his right to direct and lead others. People of this type often speak as if they are making declarations - confidently, in a commanding voice. Does not allow himself to be leniency (thinks this may turn around negatively). Prefers to only make demands. Uses every opportunity to show his volitional qualities: determination, perseverance, steadfastness, showing himself in the light of a strict but fair leader. 
</p><p>The ESTp usually excels in roles of leader-organizer: he accurately assesses the qualifications of his workers, asks the top performance from everyone, and assigns work considering the optimal distribution of forces. He sets an intensive work pace in order to achieve the greatest and most productive returns within a minimum amount of time. 
</p><p>In normal life circumstances the SLE feels like he's not quite "in his element", while in emergency situations he becomes active and mobilized. For this reason, the SLE may aim to create an atmosphere of psychological tension. He may tell scary stories and paint things with dark colors - this is done to create a sense of urgency. Generally, extreme conditions invigorate Zhukov, which is why he sometimes toughens disciplinary conditions that keep his subordinates in constant tension. He may introduce unjustified "extreme-ness" into a calm work schedule: this to feels normal to the SLE, and therefore other people around him will have to make themselves comfortable with it.
</p><p>The SLE prefers group discussions of problems and solutions, but the final decision, as well as the responsibility for it, he leaves up to himself. "The battle is won not by the one who gave good advice, but the one who took responsibility for its implementation and gave the orders" — Napoleon Bonaparte. 
</p><p>The ESTp likes and knows how to take responsibility. 
</p><p>The SLE quickly grasps the present situation and the distribution of forces, makes a decision, and acts on it. He/she is able to take risks, to go "all-in". Not subject to fear. The more dangerous the situation is - the more collected and determined he becomes. In extreme conditions, ESTp's will power, determination, courage, and practical thinking help him to find a solution and a way out. 
</p><p>In critical situations, the SLE calls for decisive actions and for a "build-up of forces". (Carefree and lightweight attitudes are qualities that should not be tolerated, in his opinion.) Prefers to act calmly and very energetically, responding with a blow to a blow. In case of external physical danger he will prudently withdraw. But if under the circumstances it was necessary to engage in a conflict situation, he prefers not to retreat but to fight to the end, even to the detriment of his own interests. ("Victory at all costs!) 
</p><p>The ESTp is not inclined to adapt to his or her partner, only to dictate. Usually he tries to be polite and mature, but if his sense of self worth has been slighted, he can't hide his irritation. In the "slighted" state the SLE feels internally nervous and tries to find a way out of the situation. 
</p><p>In a group, he often takes on the role of an informal leader, the secret controller of the situation who in critical moments prefers to stay in the shade.
</p><p>The SLE speaks about expediency of action, endurance and stamina, the need to mobilize one's forces in a tone of certainty that leaves no room for objections. He likes to discuss discipline, the need to develop a strong-willed and determined character. Constantly keeps people around him in a charged mobilized state. 
</p><p>The SLE is demanding with respect to himself and others. People who do not fulfill their promises he does not respect. In his eyes, they mean absolutely nothing and he doesn't bother to hide his contempt for such people. 
</p><p>The SLE is confident in his own power and significance, as well as in his social mission. 
</p><p>Venturesome, inclined to contests and competition. 
</p><p>The SLE imposes his life values onto everyone and everywhere as a kind of absolute truth not to be questioned. He often and gladly speaks of the "harsh reality" and appreciates ability to take life "as it is". Willingly shares his life experiences, although he may be too intrusive teaching others "how to live." Always knows "how things should be" and "how they shouldn't be".

<p>Representatives of this type willingly and gladly learn their entire lives - they do so continually and everywhere. They approach any undertaking with thoroughness, gather and analyze all of the relevant information, improve their level of qualification. They enjoy working on themselves and do so extensively. They often have a wide range of interests. If the SLE conducts scientific research this is not done in expectation of ranks and awards, but documented evidence of his competence and achievements - diplomas, certificates, and other distinctions are of importance to him. The SLE admires authority figures that enjoy wide recognition and likes being able to demonstrate his own abilities in a concrete manner, although the quality of education for him is much more important than the documents that demonstrates it.
</p><p>The ESTp is frequently gifted with a good memory by nature. He forms his own opinions on a variety of topics and knows how to explain and justify them if needed. Broadly applies established facts, statistics, and historical examples. In considering a question he considers even insignificant details. If the SLE is preparing for a debate or a discussion, he selects the best evidence from the available options, tries to foresee and think over everything in advance, even to mathematically calculate it out. The SLE pays a lot of attention to the validity of information sources. If necessary, he can pick out information carefully and pedantically. Prefers not to use dubious sources. 
</p><p>"Knowledge - is power." In the system of fundamental values inherent to intellects of this type, the aspect of the logic of relationships is one of primary importance - it realizes the program of the intellect, and consequently, naturally integrates into it. In ESTp's opinion, who is informed and in the know - is protected. Consequently, one who doesn't have necessary information - is defenseless. Therefore the collection of necessary information for the ESTp is as important as the development of power potential (and in many instances for the SLE this one and the same thing). Information that is especially important the SLE can even attempt to buy, obtain through guile, or apply inconsequential to himself volitional pressure to get it "by fright".
</p><p>Information is always of value, whether it is needed or not: "Traveling to an unfamiliar town, one should learn it well - just in case it will need to be conquered" - Napoleon Bonaparte. Much help in gathering information the ESTp gets from dual, the INFp, who strives to be "in the course of events", has numerous useful and useless contacts, is able to unobtrusively involve in a conversation even the most uncommunicative person, and with his extraordinary curiosity is often interested in everything that could be of use to him. 
</p><p>ESTp's willful pressuring is often realized by method of logical argumentation and persuasion. To accomplish this, nature has endowed him with flexible, adaptive logic, which primarily serves the purposes of his volitional "program" function. 
</p><p>In drawing conclusions on any subject the SLE is not always objective since he is coming from his own "program" distribution of forces, from his own personal interests and goals. Therefore, debating with an ESTp you should always keep in mind that some of the facts cited by him may not be objective truth, but these get voiced to support undeniable recognition of his personal point of view and his belief system. Arguing with SLE is thus often a pointless endeavor. Immediately one can see the bias and speculative nature of his arguments, the tendency towards simplistic conclusions, to resolution of problems by method of "yes-no". An impression arises that for the SLE there exist no shades of grey and things are only "white" or "black". 
</p><p>For example, it is not always feasible to discuss some personal plans with the ESTp, because he will correlate them to his own goals and base his advice on his own abilities and potential to succeed. The SLE won't allow anyone to outdo him, to "stake out" that "gold mine" that he himself hasn't yet reached. All of his logic and arguments, the whole force of his beliefs will be aimed to prove to the person to not do it. The ESTp won't give advice that goes against his own interests and goals.
</p><p>Objective truths are typically used by ESTp not for detached mental rumination, but as a means of building a deliberate argument. He will advance and defend his point of view even if it goes against the general public opinion, meanwhile using any and all allowed and disallowed methods of debate: he can raise his voice, use emotional or even physical pressuring: in an argument he doesn't seek truth but victory. When he doesn't have means of persuading his opponent, he turns to other participants and observers of the dispute to try to mock and discredit his opposition. He feels the need to win by any means possible. 
</p><p>The SLE often finds a way to have the last word, decimating his opponent with one replica or a single phrase voiced at the right moment. 
</p><p>Of course, people of this type need knowledge not only to win arguments and earn credibility. Ability to think logically - is the most important tool of their intellect.

<p>ESTp's "program" of willful priority constantly requires from him the ability to be farsighted and prudent in all of his actions. Oversights for him turn into the defeat of his own plans, crumbling of his own career, and displacement from leading positions into lower roles. Playing on a large scale the SLE also risks losing big. 
</p><p>As for any sensing type, it is characteristic for ESTp to speak with maximum concreteness, which inevitably leads him to say something extra that may be turned against him. He himself may say: "My tongue is my enemy." However much he may try to develop such qualities as discretion and caution in communication with unfamiliar people, he will never stop speaking concretely, focusing his attention on concrete train of thought and on concrete reasons and facts. For instance, a SLE negotiator says: "Our company will give you a discount on payment for expensive emergency medical services. For this you will be paying monthly ... " - "Wait a moment." - a customer objects - "I must pay for a discount on payment for medical services that I don't plan to use in the next few years?! So in how much is this "discount" going to be?!"
</p><p>Somewhere in his arguments the ESTp gives a "trump card" against himself. His logic is intuitively weak, in part because it's so strong in its willful pressuring. His arguments always constitute some kind of immediate benefit. Their persuasiveness is based not on the actual and real data, but on the desired, tossed up one. (Due to their ability to convince others with the aid of carefully selected facts, representatives of this type magnificently work as mediators in any commercial ventures. They can boisterously trade in "doughnut holes", in which they are frequently exposed.) If only with such overwhelming volitional sensing the SLE would also be invulnerable by intuition... Unfortunately, in nature one excludes the other making this impossible. However much the SLE tries to develop this function, it will never be sufficiently strong for him. It even happens that by this he weakens his "program" function: he starts to wait and calculate his chances when he needs to act and proceed forward with will and determination.  
</p><p>In any event, the ESTp will have to take into consideration calculations on the aspect of "intuition of possibilities", especially at the early stages of making social contacts.
</p><p>The SLE is very careful in establishing new contacts with other people. He is alert and cautious in communication with new people: on one end, he is controlling his own behavior trying to make a maximally favorable impression, on another end - he is constantly observing his conversation partners, trying to correlate their volitional potential with his own. Quite often the SLE will himself create situations that demonstrate the distribution of forces: he may declare his right to lead or to take initiative in something, and then observe the reaction of the others. Sometimes he tries to turn the situation to make his partner become more dependent on him. In some instances he does this out of habit - such is his already formed style of communication, in other instances - for the purposes of the "reconnaissance" of the permissible possibilities.
</p><p>With all of his external straightforwardness the SLE is capable of showing miracles of adaptability. He's quite conforming. He knows how to adapt the predominating public ideology, such that even other people who know him become confident in his absolute unscrupulousness and dedication. 
</p><p>After the ESTp outlines a goal for himself, he never moves straight towards it. On the contrary, he may play a role of a completely disinterested person, at the same time evaluating possible methods of action. He may try to use his personal charm or exert his influence through friends and other connections - in short, he will search for "levers of influence", relying on the already existing network of connections and hierarchies, trying to find the "necessary person" or the "necessary group". (The strategy of "compressing iron loop".) The ESTp does not waste his own efforts in vain - he applies them only when it is necessary.
</p><p>The ESTp likes to play a role of "patron-benefactor, a kind of "godfather" (or a general father figure - "Lenin and children" ...).
</p><p>Being a professional politician, the ESTp knows how to skillfully navigate and maneuver, but he never loses his "own line" and his "own course". He doesn't go further than short-term concessions. He builds his strategy counting on his ability to improvise for success: "The main thing is to engage, and from there we'll see".
</p><p>The ESTp dislikes working under conditions of a rigid framework. He needs freedom of action and a large scale. His plans are dynamic and get constantly corrected in accordance to the real circumstances. He fears acting in untimely manner, and when possible he resorts to expectant tactics, saving up his initiative and decisive breakthrough activities up until the necessary moment. He listens to all who can give an effective counsel; loves to converse with specialists and to learn from them. 
</p><p>Of plans for the future the SLE tries to speak confidently and with optimism, although he's not always confident in a successful outcome.
</p><p>The ESTp doesn't allow himself to talk of his own misfortunes and lack of success even in a circle of closest friends. (In the dual pair SLE-IEI "unlucky wretches" are not valued very highly, thus the SLE does everything possible to hide this.)
</p><p>The ESTp does not allow anyone near his own connections. He does not under any circumstances disclose his own acquaintances, even though he attempts to make an impression of a person who has everything "under control" and "in his grip". He indeed has everything "in his grip" but only for himself and his own people - a quality that greatly attracts his dual, the IEI, to him.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="4th_Function_-_Fi_Introverted_ethics"> 4th Function - Fi <a href="index.php@title=Introverted_ethics.html" title="Introverted ethics"><img alt="Fi" src="images/a/a3/Symbol_r.gif" width="12" height="12" /></a> <a href="index.php@title=Introverted_ethics.html" title="Introverted ethics">Introverted ethics</a> </span></h3>
<p>The ESTp does not build any illusions concerning his own ethical qualities, for he usually knows of his own unpleasant traits, such as initial distrustfulness and the habit to suspect poor motives in the actions of other people (as a consequence of having aspects of "ethics of relations" Fi and "intuition of possibilities" Ne in weak vulnerable positions). Unfortunately the SLE proceeds to form his personal relationships coming from his ethical "complexes" and fears and basing on his own mistrust and misunderstandings - this is one of the biggest and most serious problems of people of this type.
</p><p>The ESTp is often worried that his own negative personal "imperfections" are apparent to people around him and serve to undo that positive image of "strict but fair leader" that he diligently tries to create in accordance with his "program" function and the function of his intellect. (Concerning the ethicalness of his own volitional program the SLE indeed does not harbor any illusions: of what kind of ethical rights and freedom of choice can there be any discussion if we're talking about Zhukov's autocratic authority and singularity of will, and about his stubbornness and propensity to dictate in respect to his partners?)  
</p><p>How other people relate to his opinions and his authority is of exceptional significance to the ESTp - this is much more important to him than for representatives of other sociotypes. Since his intellect and capability are of primary value to him, it is important to the SLE that these qualities are valued not only by him, but also by other people.
</p><p>To the ESTp it is also important that he is perceived not only as he appears to be, but also as he could potentially be if he's treated and related to well. It is important that he is received and evaluated not only as he is, but also taking into consideration his positive ethical potential. (Precisely what his dual, the IEI, sees and evaluates well.) The SLE doesn't bring up immediately how he can be good, but speaks about this in hints and sometimes in jest. He is sufficiently prudent to not talk of this openly and directly. In addition, it seems out of place and inappropriate to him to voice praises to himself (since he is subconsiously oriented at his dual who sees this well).
</p><p>For ESTp it is very important to be correctly understood, especially by people whom he intends to bring closer to himself. For such a person the SLE may willingly talk about his own nature, how he usually reacts to this or that behavior, what he likes and dislikes about other people.
</p><p>It is important to the ESTp that other people don't assume bad intentions in his actions. Harshness and suspiciousness he saves for the enemies, while for his friends he's always ready to prove his good disposition by deeds. If a friend needs help providing which may bring trouble to himself, Zhukov may propose an equivalent service from his end, but one without negative consequences. (For example, if his friend requests him to sign guarantee obligations, the SLE will most likely refuse, but instead he may offer to lend a sum of money for a lengthy period of time.) Zhukov is ready to help not only his friends but also friends of his friends, of course granted that when circumstances arise these people will return the favor.
</p><p>And nevertheless for SLE it is not enough to be respected, it is also important to be loved. "To fall in love is not the main thing, the main thing is to make others fall in love with you." One of the problems that the SLE encounters in his personal relations is that he doesn't believe and trust in just any proof of love. 
</p><p>Building his relations in conditions of understated ethical self-appraisal, the SLE fears to bridge the psychological distance - he fears that upon closer examination he won't be considered as attractive of a subject. Such an attitudes makes the SLE act in a very strained, illogical, and unnatural manner in terms of ethics of relations. Quite often, upon achieving some positive consideration and response, he himself will break off the relations (men of this type will actively reduce physical distance, but not personal and ethical one).
</p><p>Representatives of this type struggle with forming personal relations also because they have very distant idea about how this should be done. In a vaguely defined ethical situations they feel themselves helpless and disoriented. 
</p><p>Needing to control the primary initiative at any cost, the SLE creates a large number of ethical problems for himself, in at least by the fact that he doesn't allow freedom of choice to his partner (this is assuming a psychologically incompatible partner). The SLE begins to strongly suppress his partner with his own opinions, his own authority and strength: he starts to decide on everything for his partner, thinks through everything in advance, places his partner under severe conditions, not allowing for any objections from his or her end. For example, the SLE can immediately and unshakably specify the schedule and duration of meetings: "On Tuesdays and Thursday 1-2pm. Otherwise it's inconvenient for me." He may insist on specific conditions of meetings: "If we happen to run into each other by accident, act like we're not acquainted. Nobody should know that we have been meeting." Additionally, the SLE may act like this not because he is currently married. Even if right now he is single and free, it's not out of the question that in the future he will marry someone else, and right now he is worried that his current connection may somehow influence his future family relations. The SLE tries to develop his intuition and to be farsighted even if it's to the detriment of his current relations. That with such behavior he offends and deeply upsets his partner is a question of secondary importance to him, but precisely the one that starts causing problems in due time.
</p><p>The SLE commits a serious mistake in attempting to take initiative in ethical matters. It's not enough for him to want to be viewed not as he really is but as he wishes to be seen. He goes further and attempts to model and build his relationships on this sufficiently unstable basis. And, it goes without saying, he wants these relationships to then develop in the way he wants them to develop. For this reason the SLE is not against sorting out his relations over and over again. Alas, this is something the SLE should not do! He won't find out anything good for himself. Since good relations and positive consideration are already apparent to him, while bad relations are not necessary to make explicit. Why strive to hear unpleasant things about oneself? Listening to bad and unpleasant things about himself only aggravates SLE's complexes and lowers his self-appraisal, which turns him into precisely that monster as he has been described. The SLE must not be given an occasion to feel that he is "bad" - this won't lead to anything positive. His own deficiencies should not be "poked into his face" - this only makes him more harsh and callous.  
</p><p>Neither should one try to force the "good with fists", the "militant good" onto him - he doesn't believe in this type of "good".
</p><p>In view of his pessimism and his weak intuition, the ESTp does not allow himself to fully believe in the idea of initial goodwill, unconditional love, and all-encompassing goodness. The ESTp only believes that which he sees for himself, that which unfolds right before his eyes, namely - in concrete relations with a concrete person in which he felt himself well.
</p><p>With every partner the SLE feels himself in a way that he has been evaluated. Moreover, one doesn't need to tell him of this directly - the SLE is very perceptive of how his partner evaluates him by his look, by the tone of his voice, by the smile and the expressions on his face. Therefore, a partner may disappoint an ESTp with a low evaluation even earlier than the ESTp disappoints him by his behavior. The ESTp feels lack of prospects and promise of relations very keenly and starts to behave himself accordingly.
</p><p>If the SLE feels that his partner's appraisal is too low, he may try to demonstratively raise it and try to show himself off in a better light than he thinks his partner sees him. By this the SLE attempts to give hints to his partner about how he should be treated and how to relate to him: only in a good and positive way, only in the most well-wishing and friendly form. 
</p><p>The SLE can also continue existing relations on a purely physical or formal level, while in the spiritual and intellectual sense they have already ended for him long time ago. 
</p><p>It is needed from morning to evening to tell ESTp how good, great, and kind he is - this is the only way to help him manage his ethical problems. For this very reason, positive relations for the ESTp develop in partnership with his dual the INFp, who, by nature of having strong intuition and optimism permits himself the luxury of seeing people as they present themselves. Being sincerely captivated by talents and merits of the ESTp, the INFp significantly boosts his self-appraisal, which then raises IEI's value in SLE's eyes. The SLE will be deeply grateful to a person who will convince him that he is actuality good, one who will convince him that he is second to none. Then the SLE with all his strength and forces will try to support and affirm this opinion.

<p>The ESTp with characteristic to him forward-pushing vigor and onslaught by nature can't stand any hesitancy and doubt. For example, when settlement of some urgent to him matter extends to an indefinite period of time. In such situations the SLE feels very worried. It seems to him that his entire life is put at stake. 
</p><p>The ESTp with difficulty endures forced inaction in periods of uncertainty. He/she is very vulnerable in such moments.
</p><p>The ESTp is suggestible by various forecasts and prognoses. Wary of the gloomy ones. For this very reason representatives of this type are inclined to listen to conjectures that are based on divination, omens, and guess-work. Some of them (especially women) believe in astrological prognoses and try to coordinate their plans and actions accordingly. Moreover, this is sometimes helpful for them. Particular in cases when some prognosis reads: "This week you shouldn't worry over minor things and try to figure out your relations, but live with certainty and peace. Rest more and take care of your health." Approximately the same thing will be told to an ESTp by his dual the INFp, who is able to see his emotional state and to know what he needs; even the most gloomy news the IEI presents with an encouraging smile, as if suggesting that all these troubles and difficulties are temporary and will soon pass.
</p><p>Being in a position of forced expectation weighs heavily on the SLE. He is especially annoyed by personal relations that require large time expenditures: for example, when he is led on by empty promises, when he is played and turned down, when he is encouraged to extensive partnership or courtship that doesn't lead to any outcome. The SLEs don't like this in the smallest bit, and some will admonish their new friends that such "games" could be turned around. 
</p><p>The ESTp dislikes unforeseen expenditures of time. For example, when a stranger's problems are imposed on him, since this will tie up his own time and energy. The SLE usually has little conception of how much time he has in spare, how he could use this time and what he can occupy himself with. Sometimes it seems to the SLE that his time is being used too unproductively, so he proceeds to fill up his schedule, and then it seems to him that his time is oversaturated with some matters that are standing dead still and to advance them will again require more time.
</p><p>The SLE often runs into some problems with time allocation for completing the necessary work. Many people of this type will thoroughly structure their day, try to carry out that which was outlined for the day, be everywhere on time, not be late to anything - and nevertheless there constantly come up some unforeseen circumstances that shift their plans to one direction or another. As any sensing type, the ESTp tries to accomplish the maximum amount of work in a single unit of time, which goes without saying leads to an overload, excessive stain and stress. Thankfully the SLE has such a great consultant as the IEI, who is keen on timeliness and opportuneness of any matter and any work, and who can remind the SLE of the fact that "work will never cease", such that the SLE indeed starts to notice that he has been working too hard and needs to take a break.<br />
[*Translator's note: It has been noted that ESTps may have health problems at a relatively early age because they put excessive strain on themselves and/or take up physically heavy or risky tasks while not being attentive enough to being injured.]
</p><p>Moreover, the IEI is also aware of the "critical time" - the time of live and active action, the time of "decisive impact", the time when delaying and waiting any more is "akin to death".
</p><p>The IEI also sees the ethical potential of a person as it unravels over time. He can answer questions of the type: "What should I expect from this person?", "Is he sincere?", "Is he a friend or an enemy?".
</p><p>In these vital life questions the SLE relies on the advice of his dual the IEI.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="6th_Function_-_Fe_Extraverted_ethics"> 6th Function - Fe <a href="index.php@title=Extroverted_ethics.html" title="Extroverted ethics"><img alt="Fe" src="images/2/20/Symbol_e.gif" width="12" height="12" /></a> <a href="index.php@title=Extraverted_ethics.html" title="Extraverted ethics" class="mw-redirect">Extraverted ethics</a> </span></h3>
<p>Subconsciously the ESTp tries to subordinate his feelings to reason (as any logical type). For example, he tries so that his mood wouldn't affect neither his work nor his relations with subordinates and coworkers. The SLE will often try to keep the same, level, affable tone with everyone.  
</p><p>However, the ESTp experiences difficulties expressing his emotions flexibly and adequately to the situation. Weak ethics of relations (Fi) creates problems for his ethics of emotions (Fe). For example, finding himself in an awkward and uncomfortable ethical situation the ESTp will endure psychological discomfort for a while, then spill the emotions he has accumulated with double the force in a completely different situation, at an inappropriate moment and onto an innocent person.
</p><p>The ESTp suffers much from the emotional contradictions of how he feels himself to be and how he tries to present himself. The ESTp - is always a deep and passionate emotionality underneath the mask of restraint and imperturbability.
</p><p>The positive emotions of SLE - is his deepest, most intimate secret, which he won't disclose to his closest partner. 
</p><p>Negative emotions he pours out however much is desired, on whomever is nearby, and at the first convenient moment.
</p><p>The ESTp may reproach and scold himself later for unrestrained outbursts and out-pours of negative emotions. He worries about their potential consequences, for his own reputation and how others will come to see him. He may regret the fact that he has unduly offended or upset a person.
</p><p>The ESTp is inclined to compassion, but also to self-admiration of his own noble impulses. Moreover, for him it is very important to explicitly demonstrate his ethical potential, since this makes it easier for him to turn attention to his merits and positive qualities and to give his relations the needed interpersonal tone. For this very reason the SLE is uncomfortable with any remarks that good should be done undemonstratively - such comments he receives as a rebuke, as a criticism of motivations for his behavior, as a "stone thrown in his garden".
</p><p>Fortunately, for representatives of this type there is such an "ethical outlet" as religion that encourages them to the best motives, activates their most positive emotions, and makes it possible for them to create good in that form, which is most convenient and and most natural for them. Furthermore, religion helps them to realize their innermost and therefore still untainted, sacred and sincere feelings. If next to the ESTp there is no worthy of his love person, then it is good that there is someone or something that can be entrusted with the utmost secret thoughts and desires. Moreover, the expression of such feelings in this case is even encouraged and one needs not to be ashamed of them.
</p><p>There is another "outlet" or opportunity where one needs not be ashamed of one's feelings - these are groups of creative artists and actors. Here the SLE may show himself in the full splendor of his strengths and temperament. Although even actors of this type nevertheless find it necessary to limit themselves in emotions: "I came to the conclusion that an actor must live emotionally sparingly, otherwise there won't be enough emotions neither for work nor for life" - Alisa Freundlich. 
</p><p>The SLE often feels himself as a lonely and misunderstood person, therefore he's shy to show his true feelings in a group of unfamiliar to him people. Usually he will try to link his mood to the general emotional tone, though he doesn't always succeed in this and is sufficiently often "off key" which is sometimes very apparent and not always pleasant to the people around.
</p><p>Sometimes, joining a new social group, the SLE frequently and inopportunely takes onto himself the role "of mass organizer - joker" (more characteristic for men) but doesn't always make successful jokes, which leads to unpleasant consequences. Sometimes the SLE attempts to unjustifiably assume the role of a leader and is greatly offended when he is "put in his place"; in such instances he may flare up and even get into a physical altercation.
</p><p>Sometimes the SLE acts the opposite - he demonstratively does not give into the general merriment, holds himself at some distance, and assumes an unapproachable-imperturbable look, "sits like priest's daughter on a bride-show" (more characteristic for women). 
</p><p>The ESTp feels disconcerted having to tell about his feelings and inner emotional experiences - for him this is a deeply private matter and an intimate topic. He doesn't know how to speak of this and feels afraid of appearing fake, ridiculous, or lacking in restraint. Indeed, any attempt to behave himself unnaturally (not in accordance with his mood) almost always turns around on Zhukov with unpleasant consequences: the second he gets too absorbed into his role, his behavior immediately begins to appear absurd, inappropriate, and sometimes exceeding the scope of decency.
</p><p>By the way, on decency: not seldom does the ESTp have serious difficulties with this. And not because he doesn't know how he should behave or that he didn't have good upbringing - here everything is usually satisfactory. (Everything that he needs to know, the ESTp always knows.) But the moment the ESTp relaxes and loosen up a little bit (this most frequently happens around guests) as he starts to "fall out of his role" and feel embarrassed and perplexed by this very circumstance, and, consequently, he also starts to react sharply and sensitively to any observations and remarks. It is sufficient for someone present to react inadequately to his joke or statement for ESTp's emotionalism to pass the boundaries of the permissible. If precisely at this moment the ESTp is reminded of decency and appropriateness, he may completely lose control over his words and actions. Perhaps this is why many ESTps try not to relax too much around guests or to receive guests at their home where they feel themselves more composed and confident.
</p><p>ESTps themselves suffer from their own hot tempers and usually regret their lack of restraint: they regret that they've said too much in the heat of the moment, that they might have offended someone, that someone might think poorly of them now. Some, and especially women of this type, will try to made amends for this. Often SLEs will scold themselves for having a "difficult" character and don't know whom to consult on this question. They understand that this forms a serious problem in their communication and relationships with others.
</p><p>The situation improves in the presence of ESTp's dual the INFp, who knows how to take on light and unconstrained tone of interaction, how to discharge a situation, how to brush over someone's awkwardness and direct attention to something more pleasant and more interesting. The IEI knows how to find a tactful compliment and a friendly word.
</p><p>It is only in company of the IEI that the SLE can truly relax, loosen up a bit, and receive ethical support and help. Next to the INFp the ESTp literally rests with his soul.

<p>On this aspect there are some observable differences between the men and the women of ESTp type. 
</p><p>ESTp man is enduring and low-upkeep. He doesn't invest much time on creating comfort. He strives that everything in his home is more or less clean, that items are in their places, and that the food is fresh and healthy. And this for him is sufficient. He dresses conveniently and inconspicuously, adheres to a specific neutral style that is immune to fluctuations in fashion.
</p><p>ESTp women are another matter: they spend massive efforts, time, and attention on creating domestic comfort. The house is kept in exemplary order (especially before guests arrive). Everything is clean, everything shines. The furniture is quality and old-fashioned. There may be many decorative additions in their homes: porcelain figurines, crystal vases, napkins, curtains, large paintings on walls, house plants in planters - to put is briefly: everything as it's supposed to be. They cook magnificently well, know how to bake, and how to make pickled foods and sweet jams. Some may have houses out in country where they spend their weekends and vacations. They may follow fashion and know how to sew, but they keep a certain individual style and prefer bright but noble tones. They like music and art. The ESTp woman is always "a hard worker and a chipper singer and dancer".   
</p><p>SLE type of aesthetics can be encountered in Russian national folklore. This is always the high-quality, well-made, fanciful, decorative-applied art, vividly painted and richly finished with gold. This is also a unique song folklore where special attention is given to "aching" and "pining" ethical problems, contemporary "urban romance", featuring the theme of "love as a villain" and the "bold brazen girl" who is good in everything but unfortunate in love. SLE may not talk about love, but they cannot not sing about it.
</p><p>The ESTp woman - is the one "will enter a burning house, and will stop a stampeding horse". She is capable of incredible self-sacrifice and shows miracles of endurance and fortitude. She can pull her responsibilities day after day without complaints and quibbling. She doesn't like to complain, nor to fall sick, for she doesn't want to wallow and "go sour". When sick the SLE finds it especially difficult to associate with other people; he himself is afraid of own weakness - it seems to him that he will remain like this forever. The SLE tries to be always active, composed, and cheerful whatever it costs him.

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="8th_Function_-_Te_Extraverted_logic"> 8th Function - Te <a href="index.php@title=Extroverted_logic.html" title="Extroverted logic"><img alt="Te" src="images/1/12/Symbol_p.gif" width="12" height="12" /></a> <a href="index.php@title=Extraverted_logic.html" title="Extraverted logic" class="mw-redirect">Extraverted logic</a> </span></h3>
<p>The ESTp - is one of the most practical types of people. He/she tries to explain any action by considerations of expediency. "I never do useless things" (Bonaparte). 
</p><p>The ESTp is demonstratively practical. No one better than the ESTp knows how to evaluate the commodity qualities of things, no one better will see their advantages and disadvantages. The ESTp possesses the best memory of "commodity" qualities of objects - their price, form, color, smell, taste, and so forth.
</p><p>It is impossible to force the ESTp to pay for a thing more than it is worth. Moreover, the ESTp won't make it possible to "hype" himself up to make excessive, in his understanding, expenditures. He almost never makes unfavorable acquisitions.
</p><p>Irrespective of his income level, the ESTp always lives within the boundaries of his budget, due to which he sometimes imparts an impression of a person who is "well to do" but "close-fisted". He manages his household very economically, tries so that it would be "wasteless", so that nothing extra would go unused and thrown out. For example, an ESTp woman would gather remaining small pieces of soap in order to use them to wash dishes. An ESTp may attempt to find a way to use a single-use thing twice, but if nothing comes out of this he/she nevertheless will try to find it some application in the household.
</p><p>To toss out edible produce is unthinkable for Zhukov! He buys products at cheapest prices and only those that have the minimum amount of "chaff". 
</p><p>The ESTp takes good care of his things. He wears clothing for a long time, strictly dividing casual home sets from formal ones. Simple yet practical clothes he reserves for home matters, and high-quality good looking clothes - for going out.
</p><p>The ESTp likes and knows how to work. He tries to achieve the highest level or qualification in any matter. He carries out his work quickly and qualitatively. "The greatest depravity of all - is to undertake a matter which you don't know how to do" (Bonaparte). The ESTp likes to demonstrate his skill and aptitude and always act accurately and in accordance to the circumstances. 
</p><p>When assigning some task the ESTp explains it with maximum clarity. If a colleague doesn't understand the first time, the ESTp will explain as many times as is necessary, until he is understood (this is a subconscious expectation of weak logic of his dual). The ESTp also won't make it possible to act contrary to his explanations. Feels offended if others don't request explanations from him. He perceives this as an understated estimation of his practical and logical acumen.
</p><p>For the ESTp it is very important that others would praise his work and put it as an example to others. It sometimes seems to him that he works only towards this purpose.
</p><p>Despite the fact that the ESTp can't stand sloppiness and carelessness, he can look at the mistakes of his employees with leniency, provided that they invest effort into their work or at least create a visibility of it (by this the ESTp helps his dual the IEI to at least appear to be productive, to somehow realize IEI's productive qualities).
</p><p>When the ESTp intends to attain someone's positive consideration, he does not wait until he's asked about help but readily offers his own services. (An example of SLE's type of help is Tatiana Dogileva's character in the movie <i>Blonde Around the Corner</i>&#160;: "Do you need a ticket to the swimming pool? No problem!", "Do you need an imported furniture set? No problem!" The SLE will always have the "necessary person" who can help with the arrangements.)
</p><p>The ESTp likes to solve everyday problems of people whose appreciation and friendship he/she would like to earn. It greatly pleases him to appear to be the person "who has everything in his grip". Being oriented at weak logic of his dual the INFp, the ESTp assumes that the best method to conquer the trust and love of a person - is to propose effective help in resolution of his or her concrete everyday problems. 
</p><p>Therefore, if ESTp's helpfulness seems too obtrusive or is not entirely correctly received and interpreted by people around him, he experiences this painfully and considers this to be his ethical mistake or oversight. (For this reason, it is sincerely upsetting that the business qualities of the "blonde" played by Tatiana Dogileva remained underestimated and unrealized.) 
</p><p>The INFp is one of the few types who will with enthusiasm and deep gratitude receive generous and sincere concern of the ESTp, and who will never cease to admire his dual's pragmatic practical qualities, dedication, and selflessness in work.
