<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_place_of_Quadra_among_other_groups">The place of Quadra among other groups</span></h2>
<p>Quadra as a typological group was discovered at the dawn of socionics by A. Augustinavichiute. It was assigned the properties of most comfortable and productive group. Since those times, this concept has been elevated to a kind of a cult. Aushra herself has even promoted a slogan of "quadratization of society" [1] i.e. connecting people into groups on principle of their quadra belonging, which was supposed to provide each person with a long awaited feeling of freedom and happiness. Unfortunately, many of the current schools of thought in socionics haven't progressed far beyond this hype and are still looking for the causes of social and psychological unsettlement and dissatisfaction of an individual in being forcefully subjected to conditions of "foreign" quadra.
</p><p>The school of type analysis in principle opposes any kind of absolutization as an approach that is deprived of any logical basis. If in actuality there existed any such ideal group, then it would have become established and reinforced by social norms and practices as well as by natural selection. So far, the magic power of quadral groupings has not been demonstrated by any experiments. This, of course, doesn't mean that it is a completely useless grouping. Among other subgroups of the Socion, quadra groupings take a special place, because they allow for modeling of natural chronological cycles.
</p><p>To take a broader view, A. Aushra has in fact had the honor of discovering the first functionally complete groups. Functionally complete groups are defined as groups that include all four of Jungian functions that reflect the main "sides of the horizon" of communicative space – perception of the effects of surrounding world through senses (Sensing - S), their formatting by means of generalization into concepts (Intuition - N), their comparisons and contrasts and decision making (Logic - T) and subjective-emotional assessment of people and events (Ethics - F).
</p><p>Quadra is one of the functionally complete groups, and thus it is very different from functionally-specific groupings, that are based shared one or two of Jungian functions. Certainly, it is not possible to build a quadra solely based on Jungian functions. By method of recombining them in pairs, it is possible to divide the Socion into six kinds of small groups, and all of them will be specialized in their nature – unite the sociotypes that are funtionally more alike each other than different. The list of groups formed on Jung's basis the reader can find in my work "Typological Wholeness of the Socion" [7].
</p><p>Quadra due to their particular historical origin have interested me for a long time. My first independent topic in socionics has been quadral dynamics. This topic I have discussed at length with A. Aushra. The main conclusion at which I have arrived at that time was the effectiveness of intraquadral unwinding of the Socion for modeling processes that unfold over sufficiently long periods of time [4,5]. Since quadral groupings formed a good approximation to the peculiarities of the psychology of completed historical epochs, I have drawn from this concept for modeling macro-evolution in society.
</p><p>A functionally specialized group is strongly dependent on its location in communicative space: if, for example, a group of "managers" (STs) finds itself in the humanitarian sphere (NF), it won't be of much use or help – it will simply try to impose its "technical" way of life, or will be put in its place by united against them humanitarians. A functionally complete group practically is independent from its location in communicative space, since it is universal in the level of solvable issues. Instead, it is very dependent on the factor of time: such groups are not quickly organized, a period of frictions and adjustments is needed, when informal distribution of roles and timely succession of relay of communicative estafette take place. This characteristic of functionally complete groups being endowed with a inner fixed rhythm gave me an idea that quadral groupings reflect discrete periods of the unfolding of any natural process in time. 
</p><p>Many heated discussions have happened in the Kiev socionics club and during socionics conferences on the topic of quadral succession in the progression and evolution of history. However, many questions still remain unclear. In particular, is it needed that during the era of one or another quadra the main leadership positions are occupied by the sociotypes belonging to this quadra? In this article, I will try to provide a systematic presentation of all the information on quadral groupings, that has accumulated over the years.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Differentiating_traits_of_Quadra">Differentiating traits of Quadra</span></h2>
<p>Quadra, as any other subgroup of four sociotypes distinguished in the Socion, can be described analytically through the commutative (not dependent on relocations) sum of three dichotomous scales. These three oppositions I call the differentiating features of quadra. All of them are included in the well-known list of Reinin, but very little researched in practice.
</p><p>In this article, one pair of traits I will name same as A. Aushra, since this name is already fixed in everyday socionics practice. This is the dichotomy "democrats - aristocrats". Two other pairs of traits will be given names that differ from those given to them by A. Aushra, as the old names are rather awkward, both by their meaning and by their use that puts them on the same level as conventional everyday language. They seems to have been randomly and hastily chosen terms, to not leave newly originating concepts without terminological designations.
</p><p>Instead of the dichotomy "merry - serious", that is far from the requirements of practice, I will be introducing a pair of opposing traits "ascending - descending". Instead of the pair of traits "judicious - decisive", which introduces considerable terminological confusion due to "judicious" being not seldom equated as a synonym to "rational", I will use a more accurate in that sense dichotomy "central - peripheral".
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Aristocrats_and_Democrats">Aristocrats and Democrats</span></h3>
<p>"ARISTOCRATS" (second and fourth quadra). These sociotypes are distinguished by predominance of vertical communication over horizontal. When vertical communication connections there is always a hierarchical inequality: boss - subordinate, senior - junior, our person - another person, etc. Such communication will inevitably have the nature of subordination. A person in aristocratic quadra is evaluated primarily by his communicative status respective to the person who is doing the evaluation (is he on my level or not?), and later on the other criteria.
</p><p>The degree of expression of the "aristocratic" trait, understood in a broad sense as subordination, is different for two aristocratic quadra. The second quadra has a more vividly expressed "aristocratic" trait than the fourth one. "Aristocracy" of second quadra is harsh and undisguised. It is always the division into servants and masters, talent and mediocrity, friends and enemies, which inevitably leads to a caste based social structure in the period of predominance of second quadra.
</p><p>In the fourth quadra there are no such social contrasts, therefore their "aristocratic" trait appears to be smoothed out. However, types from this quadra are also guided by the principle "ours - theirs" in assessing people. Are others living by the same laws as we are? Neither do doubts about the optimal nature of this quadra's priorities come up. The image of an enemy, as in the second quadra, is not formed, but people who behave in uncivilized way or simply intellectually immature individuals are put into second-class category.
</p><p>For "aristocratic" quadra time flows linearly and not cyclically. They can clearly separate past from future. Second quadra is oriented towards the future: this quadra is similar to a fired arrow that pierces time. Past is not valuable for the second quadra, on the contrary, it always carries a negative connotation. In the best case it is declared that it is needed to take up the most valuable developments, and move ahead. It is the second quadratic that produces ideas of the "ideal" governments of the future and tries to benefit all humankind by attempting to build them. The fourth quadra is more focused on the past, which is usually endowed by a positive image of established traditions that should not be changed but observed. Sociotypes of fourth quadra are opponents of various social experiments. In any case, due to the linearity of time perception in the two "aristocratic" quadras there is no recurrence of events, standing in one place in time. In periods of "aristocratic" quadra, there are no long period of stagnation or stasis.
</p><p>"DEMOCRATS" (first and third quadra). In these quadras the principle of horizontal communication predominates, that is, communication on equal terms, when there are no leaders and followers, people who are better or worse. The partner in communication is put on same level as oneself, not above or below. Accordingly, the attribute of subordination that is characteristic of "aristocrats" is missing here. Instead of power of a higher level center, "democrats" organize coordination between subjects of same level. Having hierarchical authority in periods of "democratic" quadra does not give any special privileges.
</p><p>"Democracy" as a trait is more pronounced in social organization of the third quadra. This is the most changeable quadra, which is committed to representational forms of government, constant elections and re-elections. During the period of the third quadra, tens or even hundreds of different parties become formed and enter into temporary coalitions. Interpersonal contacts are maximally informal, titles and ranks have very little weight here.
</p><p>The first quadra is not so "democratic". Although horizontal communication for members of this quadra is a matter of course, third quadra's familiarity that transgresses all boundaries is shocking here. In the first quadra there is no such blatant individualism. "Democracy" here is not used it for public broadcasting of one's deviations from the norms. In the first quadra there are no struggles of disadvantaged minorities for their rights, for the simple reason that no one infringes on their rights in the first place, and minorities do not form with a harmonious lifestyle. "Democracy" is understood by the first quadra to rationally follow from natural laws.
</p><p>"Democratic" quadra do not live in linear but in circular (cyclic) time. The third quadra has a distinctly undulating rhythm of ups and downs, which are almost impossible to predict. Therefore, the sociotypes of the third quadra are very focused on the present moment. Traditions of the past are not very meaningful for them, they are most concerned about the near-by future. Stagnation in the life of the third quadra alternates with periods of turbulent reformations, while its economy is dominated by the elements of market supply and demand.
</p><p>In the period of the first quadra, time as if completely stops. This is the quadra of homeostasis - a dynamic equilibrium of society with its environment. Violent clashes don't occur for the most part, life goes on calmly and harmoniously. First quadra exists outside of time as one big family, in which one generation takes over the place of previous generation, reproducing an almost unchanged previously developed lifestyle. To be part of this "cocoon" is very comfortable, but at the same time dangerous: any aggression from outside quickly destroys it.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Ascending_and_Descending">Ascending and Descending</span></h3>
<p>ASCENDING (first and second quadra). Ascending sociotypes move the trajectory of social development upward. They are the donors of socio-psychological energy, as they carry in themselves a collectivist beginning in long term communication. When independent but collectively oriented individuals come together, as we know, there is an amplification in the efficiency of action due to direction of effort toward a common goal. This infuses the surrounding society with additional energy, which contributes to the acceleration of social processes.
</p><p>Another explanation for the acceleration of processes in "ascending" quadras: their priorities include information aspects E and L (Fe and Ti), that are responsible for purposeful use of human emotional energy. In first and second quadra, these information aspects occupy program positions in blocks of Ego and Superid, which define the goal-orientation of a sociotype. On the function E emotional involvement of people occurs, while on the function L logically reasoned action plans are developed.
</p><p>The most orderly and energetic is the second quadra, which actualizes maximal expansion in society. In periods of the second quadra, social dynamics are directed along the trajectory of maximum ascent up to a climax, after which comes a downward period of energy-absorbing development. Second quadra is so full of energy, that when they lose sight of the purpose for struggle, it begins to destroy itself.
</p><p>The second quadra is much less full of energy and readiness for struggle in comparison to the first one, although occasionally it still brings some energy into the social movement. The second quadra cannot pump energy in one continuous stream, while burning up inside of it. It accomplishes its mission of acceleration by portions, cyclically introducing into the minds of calm and carefree living people seeds of ideas for a new kind of life. The beginning of the period of second quadra is associated with static and quietness, but as the development of new beginnings progresses, the impulses coming from this quadra become stronger and stronger, until it ignites the second quadra.
</p><p>"DESCENDING" (third and fourth quadra). Sociotypes of descending quadra absorb more energy from the surrounding society than they contribute. They can be considered to be recipients of socio-psychological energy. When the periods of these quadra come, the trajectory of social development leans down and has a strong tendency for decreasing the level of social dynamics. "Descending" sociotypes are most individualistic than collectivist, and have little desire to join forces to raise the potential of group effectiveness.
</p><p>On the other hand, "descending" quadra have common priorities P and R (Te and Fi), which by themselves do not set things in motion: "logic of actions" Te is movement based on previously stored energy, and "ethics of relations" Fi symbolizes attachment to an old, established system of relations. These information aspects are categorized as inertial, i.e. decaying with time processes. Therefore both quadra slow the movement of society, turning life to decline and abandonment of the future, as it happens to a person in the second half of his life.
</p><p>More "descending", and therefore "breaking", is the third quadra. The onset of the third quadra brings economic disorganization, fall of spirit and spoiling of morals on a mass level. The third is the most individualistic one. It operates of principle of every man for himself, while services for each other have to be paid for. During the periods of the third quadra, there is a sharp revaluation of values, generations start to conflict with each other, society goes through a "breaking point". Energy is absorbed on large scale for internal competitions and internecine wars.
</p><p>Fourth quadra is characterized by calm nature and a sober outlook on life. Therefore, the stored energy is not spent so rampantly as in the third quadra. The "descent" of the fourth quadra is akin to attainment of security in old age: it's comfortable, without sharp spikes, people feel healthy and vigorous, thus the "descent" is almost imperceptible. Still, the "descent" goes deeper and eventually leads to the agony - abrupt disturbances in the usual rhythm of life and loss of interest in the achievements of the past.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Central_and_Peripheral">Central and Peripheral</span></h3>
<p>"CENTRAL" (second and third quadra). The periods of these quadra are positioned in the middle in the overall macrocycle of social development. These periods turn out to be the most eventful and most expansive ones, and therefore attract much attention from the outside. In them, the concentration of energy per unit of communicative space reaches the highest values for a given society. For this reason, the times of second and third quadra - are the most boisterous times in history.
</p><p>Common priorities of "central quadra" - are information aspects F and T (Se and Ni), which in theory of socionics functions are interpreted as a force component in communication and the aspect of change under the influence of time, fatefulness. The fate of society is determined during the "central" period of its history, and not at the beginning or the end of its existence. It is the "central" sociotypes who are most susceptible to suggestion - persuasion and uncritical adherence to any program of external origin.
</p><p>Even though representatives of both quadra inevitably fall into the center of publicly significant events, still "centrality" as a sign of more pronounced in the second quadra and not as much in the third. This is connected with significant organizational talent of the sociotypes of second quadra and their innate penchant for collective action within the framework of strict discipline. Whatever the epoch is "outside", but in the center of any strong organizations in primary roles are people of sociotypes from the second quadra.
</p><p>Third quadra represents a kind of a center instability and anarchic tendencies. More precisely, it is polycentric - it breaks down to several local centers, that compete with each other. This quadra is much better at using force in defense rather than offense and takeover. The time of third quadra is usually characterized by the adjectives "confusing, turmoiled". It provides ground for the activities of various fraudsters and impostors. Instead of the official religion of a society, mystic and exotic cults gain popularity.
</p><p>"PERIPHERAL" (first and fourth quadra). Shared priorities of these quadra - are information aspects I and S (Ne and Si), i.e. free from ideological mix-ins style of thinking, and comfortable, nonviolent, harmonious with nature style of life. "Peripheral" sociotypes are not inclined to fight for power, to expansion and competition, as much as the "central" ones. They carry out their mission in the early onset of social development or in his late completion, when the heat and the passions of peak periods have already subsided or have not yet begun.
</p><p>"Peripheral" sociotypes rarely occupy key positions in leadership, and if they get them they don't keep there for long. If it much harder for "peripheral" sociotypes to become widely famous, to make an outstanding career, to go down in history. Even when representatives of "peripheral" quadra achieve something, success accompanies their activity only when they are on the periphery of public attention: when they live quietly, work informally, occupy ordinary positions.
</p><p>If we compare the degree of "peripherality", the fourth quadra ends up being farther away from the center of attention. Fourth quadra is opposite the second one, which is always the most likely contender for the central positions. In addition, both of these quadra are aristocratic, thus, it is understandable that their co-existence is possible only when the leading positions are occupied by the second quadra. Thus, fourth quadra types are still relegated to the periphery.
</p><p>First quadra, as a whole, gets along better with the second one, since it feeds it by its ideas. Second quadra leadership may even bring the first quadra closer to itself. In a society, periodic shifts take place from territorial margins to its center. At this time, someone from first quadra can "slip by" and due to their unconventional ideas or harmonious, non-destructive style of life take up a central position.
</p><p>Each quadra can be defined as a commutative (not dependent on the order of the traits) intersection of two dichotomous axes. The number of combinations of three pairs of traits by two is equal to three. Thus, in total there are three ways to geometrically build quadra with the use of cross-shaped intersection of polar differentiating traits on a plane. Here are these methods presented graphically:

<p>Given the differentiating features can be called the first quadrupole peripherally-ascendant "democrats". For brevity, we refer to them preparer as macroevolutionary cycle they take on the mission of preparing the start of rapid social and psychological growth later time.
</p><p>"Star" pervokvadralov always goes somewhere on the periphery. When this is meant as a place periphery and periphery time. They used to refer to the study of other phenomena that are only in the bud and does not attract the attention of powerful and influential people of the moment. A place that stimulates especially preparatory to think up brand new possibilities of life of society - this crossroads run-ways and joints conserved regions of the "sleeping" society.
</p><p>Preparatory low energy potential, so their period there are only temporary surges of public activity, which by themselves are not able to withdraw from society symbiotic state of hibernation. However, the energy is already beginning to slowly seep into every pore of a stable society, step by step approaching a critical point. And then there is an explosion: the curve of social dynamics rushes steeply upward, signaling the beginning of a broad expansion of new forms of communication, quickly displacing the old way. Time first impulse beyond the preparatory quadra - it represents the transition to the second quadra.
</p><p>Preparing ascent always going to be the democratic principles. While still very far from the future triumph without also no guarantee that this is the attempt to give healthy seedlings, a group of people united not materialistic, and reminiscent of informal friendship ties. A group of enthusiasts had time yet to be born direction does not need bosses, combines in one person who directs, with those who obey. Hierarchy of positions and titles of preparatory makes no sense.
</p><p>The main outward sign sociotypes first quadra - a "childlike", which is easily detected in the expression of their faces, and in his eyes. Their facial expressions trustful and direct, reflecting their underlying emotional state. Various deviations from nature, tricks and attempts wishful thinking so alien to them that sometimes completely "shut down" of their communication or being forced to fence his world of inner harmony of hypocrisy vnesheney environment impermeable membrane.
</p><p>Pervokvadralov eyes see the world confidently and uncomplicated. They have a double bottom, as reflected in their designs harmless. Even when they get angry, their anger is not taken seriously. It seems that it is simply passed over a small cloud that will soon dissipate and re-warm sun shine. In the wide-open eyes they show their friendliness and insecurity. From preparatory nobody expects serious danger, so harm them - is the same as that hurt children.

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Second_Quadra:_EIE.2C_SLE.2C_LSI.2C_IEI_-_implementers.">Second Quadra: EIE, SLE, LSI, IEI - implementers.</span></h3>
<p>By differentiating features trio gets the name of the second quadratic Central ascending aristocrats. Their generic name implementers because they like no other set plans for implementation in everyday life. Energetically most powerful Quadra, implementers capable of reversing the society.
</p><p>Due to its activity and aggressiveness vtorokvadraly always hit the center of any social dynamics. They especially rampant in government activities, as well as in the sphere of ideology and culture. Main carriers of "centrality" - a sociotypes Mentor and Marshall, who often act in concert. No such problems conquest that would not resolved this dangerous pair. They work well in the underground, creating illegal centralized organizations.
</p><p>implementers perfectly controlled directed energy flows. They are always on the rise, they do not accept defeat in principle. They are easier to kill yourself than to admit that their plans have the final collapse. Second quadra very ideologichna: it doubles and triples its unifying force due to their faith in the ideals for which they are able to self-sacrifice. implementers so efficacious in implementation problems because due to its emotional and volitional influence they involve radical solution to problems large numbers of people.
Quadra implementers has extremely clannish nature. On a rigid hierarchy and drawn strong hand kept their discipline. Irreconcilable division on their own and others inevitably leads to ideologically and patriotically colored wars. Two quadra will not rest until the build authoritarian centralized state and destroy the opposition. Very typical for rulers Voploiteley cult and national heroes. End of the second period is characterized by the flourishing of quadra power of the state. At the same time the transition to the next era - tretekvadralnomu period, carrying with it the collapse of the state ideology and disorganization.
</p><p>Representatives of the second quadra you learn externally by mimicry of anger and intolerance that appears from time to time on their faces. Their facial muscles as it adapted to the expression of superiority and aristocratic election. Their gestures are either demanding, decisive, or prim-cutesy, like everything they do has a "make or break" point. Since they are compressed lips or eyebrows shift, issues inherent intransigence and vindictiveness.
</p><p>In the eyes of the observer will notice Voplotitedey mad fire fanatical gleam. It may be present constantly, and can dive to the bottom of the eye, indicating that these are not the people with whom you can happily joking. Sometimes the nature of the view changes to besstrasno-violent. In these moments implementers capable of action of any degree of violence, they seem to turn into inexorable executors of the will of higher powers. It pursues voplotitelskuyu quadrupole terrible disease obsession and madness.

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Third_Quadra:_SEE.2C_LIE.2C_ILI.2C_ESI_-_vibrators.">Third Quadra: SEE, LIE, ILI, ESI - vibrators.</span></h3>
<p>By differentiating features tretekvadralnye sociotypes receive the following characteristics: Central descending "democrats". Their generic name - Vibrators - emphasizes the side of their period of macroevolution, which is associated with social instability, clearly-vibrational character development, irrationality of life at this time. Vibrators in different directions rocking mutual boat until it falls apart into separate parts. Someone will survive, while others will go to the bottom - this is the final vibrational period.
</p><p>Vibrators Voplotitelyam like fighting for the central place in public life, but they have other methods. If the second quadratic militarized and reaches its mainly by force of arms, the third quadratic abhors war. In the center of life, they are knocked out or economic or political means. Vibrators able to earn money by trading and financial speculation, they are great at negotiating and diplomatic tricks. Their trump card - no guns, and the "golden calf".
</p><p>Since tretekvadraly produce its activities destructive vibration, that is our continuing program moved to those areas of the communication space, where there is left over from the previous period, resources and energy, the time begins to degrade their collective as a whole. There is a sharp decline of morals, removed almost all taboos come to the surface the worst human instincts, starting with ending greed and perversion. Vibrating period reminds one big cleaning or washing of the social organism.
</p><p>When dominated tretekvadraly crumbling discipline and any signs of insubordination. Becoming allowed. Society is vaguely anarchic time, recovery time and the new order in the band creeping lawlessness and arbitrariness. Waves deteriorations and improvements overflowed man undermine his faith in the future. Increases the number of suicides occurring sharp stratification. Only at the end of this difficult period is gradually being established civilized democratic forms of government. An era of rebirth. But this is a transition to the fourth quadra.
</p><p>Vibrator of the outward signs draw attention to themselves, some features of their posture. For them quite characteristic short neck, causing the impression that they draw his shoulders. Often also unusual deflection body back, which leads to tilting the head forward and protrusion of the abdomen. Their posture as if reflected across the oscillatory nature quadra, generating a person "sea" ability to counter roll.
</p><p>Vibrator communication accompanies mimicry displeasure, which is read on the lips and lower face. On the other hand, when the situation in their favor, mimic signals change dramatically: there reaction smacking of lips, winks. And guess what they like and what is not very difficult. Often there is a negative development gives them a positive response and positive news - discontent.
</p><p>Something similar is also reflected in their eyes. Vibrator for uncharacteristic depth look. Expression of the eyes varies from clear interest in you to complete indifference to you and your information. And the eyes attentive diagnostician pragmatism easily read their desires. What benefits will I have with this? Their eyes are like the lens focuses on the people, in which they see any benefit for himself. They zapechetlen obschekvadralnaya philosophy: everything in this world is dirty and corrupt, it is necessary and I do not miss your chance. How much of that life?

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Fourth_Quadra:_LSE.2C_IEE.2C_EII.2C_SLI_-_perfectors.">Fourth Quadra: LSE, IEE, EII, SLI - perfectors.</span></h3>
<p>Title sociotypes four quadra recruitment describing their differentiating features - descending peripherally-aristocrats. With the advent of time fourth quadra enters into force ideology of perfectionism - bring to perfection, high-quality finishing. Perfector therefore mean uplifters. In the era of the fourth quadra nothing new is created, but is brought to perfection and completeness of all that survived the previous period tretekvadralnoy cleaning.
</p><p>Period of perfection devoid of globalism and grandeur. Perfector prefer center offshoring. First, there is no perfection in the thick of things when there is war or reform. Therefore, stable life in perfect public forms distant in time from the revolutions and abrupt turns. Secondly, life on the periphery always calmer than in the prestigious center where eager and ambitious careerists. Perfection is not there, where there is a show and the fight for the championship.
</p><p>Perfectionists do not tend to intensify social life. Before them, and so it was too violent and restless. With the advent of fourth quadra people get a chance to rest and save his strength for the simple everyday life. Oschestvo going through a phase of slow aging, politics and ideology no one is interested, predatory war is not going to lead. Who works well, does well and lives. No you do not push in the fight for ideals, no one tore off you high taxes.
</p><p>Aristocracy Perfector concluded basically that they do not want to deal with violent and intrusive people. All those who can not make a living on sound principles, they simply reject, consider themselves below the level of development. They create their own small territory maintained a comfortable life, and represents the interests of narrow specialization. Therefore chetverokvadralnaya life devoid of urgency and passion. State centralization minimal management is dispersed on a self-governing territory of the middle scale.
</p><p>Society fourth quadra slowly dying to a certain limit, beyond which comes obscuration - blackout, every kind of loss of interest in life until the complete dullness and inability to meet the basic instincts of the body. This ends the period of perfectionism. Self-destruction leads to the loss of special units of expanded reproduction and society is being reshaped to form enclave that is symbiotic existence with nature. And this is a transition in the first quadrupole - germ of a new life.
</p><p>The most telling sign of the fourth quadra external manifestations - this coldness of his eyes and expressionless facial expressions. The smallest dose of extremeness in the outside world hurt hurt them, so they destroy their critical communicative priority - calm and stable living conditions. Therefore Perfector pretty nervous sociotypes. If it is not immediately clear, it still opens at rapprochement with them.
</p><p>They accounted for a special destiny - to be perfected all macroevolutionary cycle. And print sophistication and tired of life embodied in all their characteristic appearance and manners. Perfector look as healthy conservatives that life is little that need. Their tastes and habits are far from the excesses and bombast. They prefer low-key items, but quality. They too appreciate the emotional energy to recklessly give it away to the right and to the left in the form of passion, or at least lively gestures.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="One_Turn_of_Quadral_Estafette">One Turn of Quadral Estafette</span></h2>
<p>Analyzing the processes of transition from one socio-historical era to another, I noticed that the elements of a new way of life spills out immediately, one all-encompassing wave. Usually the period going to replace the obsolete, deployed initially passive and hidden. From this fact, I concluded that each period quadra relay begins with introverted site.
</p><p>And only after introverted work to penetrate the "pores" of the social organism is done to the end, there is a bright flash of extroverted activity was concentrated wafting all members of society to changing priorities. And if at the initial stage of introverted quadra many still doubt that the new rules will supersede the old, with the onset of the last subperiod extroverted doubt the victory of reputation lifestyle completely disappear.
</p><p>Another fact that I noted in the analysis of the dynamics of the historical process - is puzzling many people due to the fact that seemingly reached a complete success and social texture suddenly very quickly and gives a crack collapses before our eyes generations of his followers. This means that people are confused flowering (akmaticheskuyu phase) era with its finale that takes place in expansively extroverted.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Intraquadral_Roles">Intraquadral Roles</span></h3>
<p>All this led me to construct a theory vnutrikvadralnoy turnover types - quadra sweep. I am convinced that represent quadrupole as a gradual increase in activity to a climax with its subsequent decline to a level below the initial untrue. Quadra period is not a bright flash with dull beginning and end, and a chain of two flashes separated introverted subperiod stabilization.
</p><p>Also after the second burst of activity followed by a sharp break quadra quadra era and goes into oblivion. The second plot in extraverted quadra is final - this is her last burst of energy, but many researchers believe its climax than violate the logic of events: is there at the top and not only the rise of descent?
</p><p>Culmination of the present only the second plot: it is separated from both sides introverted, quiet areas, indicating that its key provisions. But the public consciousness for some reason does not keep up the historical process. That's when you need to operate at full capacity, winning the maximum number of points of support in society, many workers are just sleeping, waiting for better times. This is the cause of their subsequent failures.
</p><p>Thus, the whole quadra period should be divided into four sub-periods, or stages, each of which has the character of one of the members of the quadrupole sociotypes. And alternation types built on the principle of an introvert extrovert replaced. If we ignore the projection quadra relay on the dynamics of historical epochs, it is necessary to talk about the four roles in the quadra that should be assigned to its four sociotypes. What is this role?
</p><p>The first role is performed sociotypes interrupting previous deployment program quadra and sort it a piece of information that will serve as seed capital for the native quadra. Let us call this role delousing. Beginning of a new period proceeds always implicitly, so there can be only delousing introvert. In addition to the delousing as type, standing at the entrance quadra have the responsibility for compliance verification of actions obschekvadralnoy program.
</p><p>After skipping a quadrupole done, there is an intensive expansion quadra priorities in all areas of society. Active role distribution quadra values ​​assumes one of extroverts quadra. By the end of the second phase culminates with the entire period, so performing this role sociotype called culminators. In culminators in emphatic form concentrated all its advantages and disadvantages quadra.
</p><p>Then, a feedback mechanism that adjusts the degree and direction obschekvadralnoy activity. For the culmination should introverted stabilization phase, during which the expansion is reduced, there is an internal reallocation of resources. sociotype responsible for these actions in the quadra called stabilizer. Stabilization subperiod gives quadra "second wind", preparing her for the final spurt.
</p><p>Ends beautiful quadra and unexpected flash extroverted, during which finally settled contradictions accumulated throughout the quadra period. sociotype performing sprint is called Finalist. Last shot quadra spawns many illusions about the inviolability of proven orders. With the collapse of hope and transformation processes are started, which resulted in the quadra "throws a bridge" to the other side - his smenschitsy. Therefore Finalist - is both a type mezhkvadralnogo transition.
</p><p>If we arrange vnutrikvadralnye steps in chronological order, then line up the following chain of successive roles:
</p><p>Gatekeepers - Culminators - Stabilizers - Finalists.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Chronological_progression_and_unwinding_of_Quadra.">Chronological progression and unwinding of Quadra.</span></h3>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Progression_of_quadra_of_preparers_.28Alpha.29.">Progression of quadra of preparers (Alpha).</span></h4>
<p>Propusknik preparer is Mediator. He ensures that the quadra was an atmosphere of friendliness, mental, emotional and physical comfort. In extreme circumstances (hype or its opposite spleen) its program of public search of alternatives is not realized. The culmination of the first quadra comes to the invention of a new system outlook. Satisfying the criterion of long-term cognitive theory offers inventor force.
</p><p>Its logical development analyst assumes that stabilizes the quadrupole and clearly aims at identifying and fixed target. Distributes logically reconciled system enthusiast. It was he who acts as a finalist quadra because largely committed to the organization and executive discipline coming from the second quadra.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Progression_of_quadra_of_implementers_.28Beta.29.">Progression of quadra of implementers (Beta).</span></h4>
<p>At the entrance to the quadrupole implementers worth Inspector. From the hands of the preparatory he will only what really rationalized and practically oriented. Behind him comes into operation frenetic Mentor, whose creed and ability to sacrifice themselves for the triumph of ideas is unparalleled. In tutorial subperiod new ideology really captures the masses.
</p><p>Over time, the Sturm und Drang should sociotype Lyric, whose mission - to mitigate the effects of terrorism and uncompromising mentor. Lyric stage quadra brings stabilization and romantic poetization victims who died in the struggle. Completes quadrupole marshal period when the final seizure of power, but also punched sprouts irrationality and monetary pragmatism (first as temporary concessions, and then regularly), giving a chance to rise in the third quadra.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Progression_of_quadra_of_vibrators_.28Gamma.29.">Progression of quadra of vibrators (Gamma).</span></h4>
<p>Vibration quadra opens comprehensive critique of totalitarianism and antiekonomicheskih implementers methods. sociotype critic produces a "smart" brain clearing people from ideological dogmas of the previous period. These vibrations are run at full power and reach its climax when comes the stage of Politics: blooms freedom of manners and commercial beginning in the relationship between people, organized representative forms of "democracy" and different electoral systems.
But over time, people get tired of politicking and anarchy and begin to rely on themselves, thereby entering into an ethical conflict with their own kind. A stripe of preservation and survival in the absence of disorder and strong power. This is the stage of the Guardian. The winning healthy pragmatism pushes to entrepreneurial activity. Crumbling finally canceled bureaucracy and marching on its content more taxes. Vibration quadra completed what is generally referred to as the Renaissance. In the public mind at this time gradually approved the principles of humanism. Coming fourth quadra.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Progression_of_quadra_of_perfectors_.28Delta.29.">Progression of quadra of perfectors (Delta).</span></h4>
<p>Humanist flows into quadrupole uplifters revivalist tradition positive legacy of previous quadra. There is a change in the psychology of people in the direction of greater diligence and humanity in a relationship. Comes the turn of the administrative-production stage. Deployed construction, especially suburban reviving agricultural productivity based on farming, society goes to the level of quality and welfare.
Feels accumulated fatigue. Now everyone wants to work at your own pace and no one could depend. Fever subsides administrative stage, honed individual skill. sociotype Wizard reduces productivity, but also turns the production towards a more complete satisfaction of the customer. Perfector finish on stage Advisor. On the first place there is personal bias and at the same time falls discipline. Increased interest in non-traditional approaches. Selection of people goes unusual attitudes and behavior that inevitably sets the stage for the first quadra ideological quest.
</p><p>Thus, the beginning and the end converges macroevolution chain closes. General scheme quadra coil takes the following form:
</p><p>Preparationists - implementors<br />
- (SE IL LI ES) (LF ET TE FL) -<br />
| |<br />
| |<br />
L-(IR SP PS RI) (PT RF FR TP) -<br />
Perfectors - Vibrators<br />
</p><p>The graph on the x-axis which represents time and the ordinate energy potential, quadra coil draws so-called M-shaped curve. It consists of a hollow cross section rising (subperiod preparatory), the following historical area of ​​exponential growth to climax (subperiod implementers) slump to a local minimum of the curve and the last spike (subperiod Vibrator) and the final round of the slow descent from the inflection point to the level of energy "vacuum" (subperiod Perfector).

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Reasons_for_Quadra_Progression">Reasons for Quadra Progression</span></h2>
<p>Macroevolution in society tipoanalize modeled by quadra spiral turns. That is its shape, which gives a decent approximation to the real historical processes. But what is the reason most turnover? Determining whether there is a factor that drives the wheel of human history?
</p><p>Chances are, if the only reason macroevolution and there, she succumbs to the formulation of a very, very abstract language that denies knowledge of his instrumental and transformative power. Much more practical to consider a whole range of reasons for the development of socio-psychological systems. Below I provide a variety of approaches to identifying factor "X" through which history disretna and we distinguish in its current qualitatively different periods.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Natural_causes_-_energy_conservation">Natural causes - energy conservation</span></h3>
<p>In nature, in which global conservation laws, according to which there is no perpetual motion and any development has two opposite directions, based on the exchange of energy between them when it left unchanged, within a broader system.
</p><p>With the development in the first direction is a waste of energy, by which the developing system stronger and more complicated. This upward development, it is due to the fact that elsewhere in the system is simplified and some splits, giving its internal energy fledgling organization. Reached its highest growth, the first system in turn starts to degrade, pumping energy is released in the next place, etc. This downward development.
</p><p>The second circumstance global law of energy is that each system in a given time interacts at least with the other two systems. In other words, it has its predecessor, which is powered by and formed, as well as his successor, for which acts as the energy donor herself. Formed ternary sequence "thesis antithesis - synthesis" or "subsystem - system - the super-system."
</p><p>And finally, she is confronted by equal in strength, but with the opposite sign (orthogonal) system, with which it annihilates - destroying each other, highlighting the free energy. It is due to the latter kind of interaction in the communicative space is always a free energy. Due to this excess energy and vortex method originate more new spiral quadra. Hence the conclusion that macroevolution is on converging spiral. After all, without ever closer contact antipodes did not occur to energy-dissipating annihilation.
Identified four phases of energy in physics oscillatory processes are called potential energy, the transition of potential energy into kinetic energy, kinetic energy and the return of the kinetic energy into potential energy. These phases are legitimate in nature universal. Think of the annual rhythm (spring, winter, summer, autumn), the daily rhythm (morning, afternoon, evening, night), periodization of human life (childhood, youth, maturity, old age). It is these phases correspond quadra periods. They have essentially phased attenuation initial hesitation, swung due to the annihilation of energy transfer.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Demographic_reasons_-_population_density">Demographic reasons - population density</span></h3>
<p>More specific language community macroevolution live specimens can be explained by the effects of changes in population density, inhabiting rendered habitable territory.
Starting position is a residence on the territory of the number of individuals that exactly matches the capabilities of the environment to feed the population without much damage to themselves. When dynamic equilibrium number of individuals who were born on average equal to the number of deaths, so such a symbiotic population does not increase, but not decrease. Occur only minor fluctuations population, which, however once lead to the fact that one-half of the total area of ​​the excess of births over deaths ends flash exponential population growth.
</p><p>Resources of the natural environment in this part of the population is not enough, therefore dramatically sharpened the struggle for existence. Stronger individuals displace weaker. Increases the concentration of active and aggressive members of the community on the upper floors of communicative hierarchy which redistribute limited natural resources in their favor, selecting them from the repressed to the lower level of existence relatives. In parallel with this process, the dominant part of the population forcibly seizes living on the territory of the old order of individuals and distributes them to its inequities.
</p><p>However, the vertical stratification of the population does not solve the problem fundamentally limited livelihood. By the end of the second phase of the population reaches a concentration of features, then there are two types of confrontational war: the oppressed against their masters, as well as newcomers against natives. The entire community is split into warring factions, destroying each other fiercely.
By the end of the third phase of the excess population is more than eliminated, and killed most socially active figures. Population gradually calms down. Population growth stops because in the era of internecine clashes there is a significant drop in living standards and few among the impoverished population at risk start a large number of children. People think of daily survival, not for heirs murky unknown future. Having children is delayed until later - to peace and acquisition comfortable living conditions.
However, when the strife and turmoil subside, population numbers have never recovered because the birth rate is slowly but steadily declining. Parents do not need a lot of children, because in a stable phase, they can count on guaranteed a secure old age. And educate children because of increased demands for material security is becoming harder and harder. Population therefore returns to self-sustaining balance of births and deaths, that is, in the first phase.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Economic_reasons_-_labor_productivity">Economic reasons - labor productivity</span></h3>
<p>Classics of Marxism at the forefront change of socio-economic formations predict factor productivity. According to their theory, when the existing formation ceases to satisfy demand growth in production efficiency, it becomes a drag on the economy and is coming from the historical arena, giving way to a more progressive way of.
</p><p>Marx's theory of the development of society through five socio-economic formations is consistent with the concept of the socionics quadra. However, analysis of the evolution quadra does an exceptional emphasis on economic reasons. Basic and superstructural phenomena in society are equal and can not be argued that the first defines the second. Social consciousness is equivalent to its force being exerted.
</p><p>First quadra corresponds in its basic communicative characteristics of tribal formation. At the preparatory norm is precisely the family atmosphere of dialogue: a relaxed and informal, as between brothers and sisters. Authority in this quadra not be won by force or wealth, and personal experiences and knowledge. Labor productivity in the preparatory low, there is no organizational types with F or producing P.
</p><p>Living in non-violent manner and in harmony with the environment, pervokvadraly not need in government. They have no class division of society and, as their lowly requests fully satisfies egalitarian distribution of wealth. Their own quadra preparer can somehow settle on any portion of unspoilt nature.
</p><p>Communicative features are very similar to the second quadra feudal system. It is a power and heroic Quadra, which is waging a war exists only in aristocratic forms. implementers create class society with rigid class barriers. Normal form of government they have - it's an absolute monarchy. Religion or ideology in general has in this quadra precedence over science. Dissent is eliminated as erodes public order.
</p><p>Production in the second quadra built on non-economic methods of coercion producers of wealth. Business logic P is not included in the kit voplotitelskih regulators, but rather revered strength and power - aspect F. Commodity production virtually no trade exists in the form of barter products. A large proportion of the gross national product goes to the maintenance of the army and state apparatus branched.
</p><p>Capitalist formation - this is the era of the third quadra, vibration. Instead of the power of coercion in this quadra included economic incentives. Production is regulated by market mechanisms, there is no centralized control. Dominated by commodity-money relations, everything can be bought and sold. Production is not the individual, as in the second quadra and massive. Vtorokvadralnye class mixed together.
</p><p>During tretekvadralnogo capitalism observed rise in elective politics and democratic forms. Form of government is gradually acquiring a bipartisan nature. The government is staying alternately left-centrist (social democratic, tax increases and this bill strengthening Social Security), then right-centrist (liberal, reduce taxes and encourage increased profits due to production) party and the radicals and extremists (active supporters of the second quadra) have political weight.
</p><p>Communist formation, which has not yet been realized, and many do not believe in its reality, nevertheless agrees well with the communicative priorities fourth quadra. Perfector for revealing the highest productivity (PS - the most productive type in socion) in this quadra people live the abundance of material goods. Productive accumulation is not being spent on the war, bloated bureaucracy, grandiose project of the century. Blurs the distinction between town and country. Cities monsters, these wreck nature works the third quadra lose appeal.
</p><p>In the minds of the people approved the principles of humanism and tolerance. Emotions and passions fade into the background, people are guided by a calm and respectful relationship. No crime, no one encroaches on the property of another. Political struggle few people are interested, all problems are solved locally by local authorities. Honesty and hard work is not based on some mythical consciousness (Perfector - the same people with their weaknesses, as well as other types of quadra), and at the elementary reluctance to interfere, disrupt tradition. Perfector live maximum use of each unit of energy and spend it on destructive acts will not.
</p><p>Apart from the four analyzed my main socio-economic systems, there is also the intermediate corresponding to transitions between quadra periods. Slave system - is the transition from the first to the second quadra: it combines the democratic forms of government with power operation, bold advances in science with the dominance of the religious worldview.
</p><p>Between feudalism and capitalism arose not allocated as an independent science in between traditional social structure that is logically called postfeodalnoy community. It is about the Cossack settlements in which military force forms of life intertwine with free commodity production the third quadra. Such a form of social life is not complete mandatory step in changing economic structures, as well as slavery.
</p><p>The transition from the third to the fourth quadra generates the intermediate mode, which could be called socialism, referring not so much his Soviet as the Swedish model. Under socialism, the role of public authorities is quite significant, because somebody has to redistribute wealth in favor of the weaker, but labor productivity should not suffer from the fact that there is a significant layer of not seeking to work and waiting for handouts from the government people.
</p><p>It is possible that in a more global way the transition to a quadra uplifters is a so-called post-industrial society, in which almost the contradiction between capital and labor: owners of large states voluntarily deduct a portion of their income to the needs of science, culture and social benefits. Developed computer communications allow you to participate in the production of material and information without leaving their places of residence. All this - the periphery elements inherent Perfector.

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Historical_reasons_-_passionate_impulse">Historical reasons - passionate impulse</span></h3>
<p>Convincing picture of the historical development of ethnic groups sketched LNGumilev author ethnogenesis theory [2]. However, he explains protsiskhozhdenie initial push ethnic cosmo-biological factors - special micromutations in humans, occurring under the influence of cosmic radiation. It is difficult to agree that the level of social communication space is reduced to the phenomena of the physical order. But whatever it was, Gumilev introduced the concept of drive, as the driving force of the history of peoples perfectly conveys the relationship of micro-and makrosotsiuma, man and society, are the subject of Socionics.
</p><p>LNGumilev distinguishes between three types of individuals according to their degree of drive, which is the ability to give their psychic energy not selfish, and obscheetnicheskie purpose. First, it passionary individuals who sacrifice themselves for the sake of the business, and secondly, it subpassionate who are not able to suppress my baser instincts, and harmonious people whose energy is distributed approximately equally between personal and public.
</p><p>From the point of view of socionics passionarnost most similar to the communicative aspect of the T - dependence on fate, missionary work, sacrifice, detachment from earthly things. Subpassionarnost - it's the same aspect, but taken with the opposite sign. Therefore, directly related to the actions passionarnym sotsionicheskie groups are central quadra. Most Passionary implementers quadra and most quadra subpassionarna Vibrator. Peripherals are Passionary quadra-neutral, or, if we take on Gumilev consist of harmonious individuals.
</p><p>The first phase of ethnogenesis - this initial shove collecting passionary personalities in one place and provides a rise of a new ethnic group that creates the state and expands its habitat due to conquest and absorption of other, weaker ethnic groups. By the end of the total phase of the lift comes akmaticheskaya phase - the flowering of the ethnic group, the time of his greatest power.
</p><p>Akmaticheskuyu phase unexpectedly but naturally replaces phase fracture. During this period the collapse of the empire, there were bloody clashes intraethnic raging civil war. Ethnicity shock vibrations of drive opposite signs. Surplus energy is spent on destroying passionaries each other, and part with drive leaves the nation and populates vacant land.
</p><p>After fracture ethnicity expects inertial phase - a period of slow consumption remaining stocks passionate energy. This phase is called civilization historians because ethnicity live in it peacefully and prosperously, accumulates a large amount of material culture products and leaves a lot of written sources.
</p><p>Following the coming phase inertial obscuration - the agony of drive, loss of orientation and goal setting in general, chaotic turnover priorities, decomposition and degradation of ethnicity to the most primitive forms. Dying ethnicity may actually disappear because of assimilation - traceless dissolution among younger people, and may become a relic. Relic ethnicity will exist indefinitely, while in homeostasis with the environment, or give rise to a new ethnic group.
</p><p>Thus, the scheme is slightly different from ENU our order of the quadra phases. Etnogenez Gumilev begins with quadra implementers, followed quadra Vibrator and perfector, and death ethnicity accounted for quadrupole preparer. It should be noted that the beginning of an ethnic movement Gumilev explains not earthly and cosmic causes, so preparatory macroevolution in the world to him were not needed. Yet he described as a relic of the first quadratic and have the generator mutations of products which implementers and create their unifying and spiritualize the idea.
</p><p>On the other hand, the arrangement of quadra according to Gumilev suggests that a rectangular projection on the plane turn quadra incompletely reflects the true relations between the periods. Much closer to reality volume model, which has the geometric shape of a tetrahedron.
</p><p>If we compare with each of the four tetrahedron faceted one quadra (this must be attributed to the triple form a face value corresponding edges differentiating features), then one of them will act as a base. Outside communicative space is irrelevant, what is at the bottom of the quadra. But in the real historical process as a fulcrum acts as a first time quadrature, which therefore is perceived background macroevolutionary spiral rotation axis.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Socionic_reasons_-_social_order">Socionic reasons - social order</span></h3>
<p>Clean socionical cause quadra relay makes sense to consider asymmetrical mezhkvadralnye ties that still dosotsionicheskih studies called social order. The basis of symmetry breaking is the division of all living forms of nature and society on the left and right modification. Most researchers are of the opinion that it is the left-right asymmetry, not occurring in inorganic matter, hides a secret of the origin of life [3].
Quadra in its structure is the formation of non-equilibrium, one of the components of its dual pairs of polarized, and the second, following it - left polarized. It is for this reason that the period has quadra dvupikovy rather than the single peak dates. Because the left and right halves of the quadra pulled in opposite directions, there is the potential difference which is holding back, then pushes quadra deployment program.
Through this internal mechanism bootstrapping one quadra behind the average pace, and the other, on the contrary, accelerated, taking the place of the outsider, if the natural and social environmental conditions require a different method of adaptation. Social order plays the role of an external force to choose between two alternatives the one that best fits into the altered communicative space.
</p><p>Social order internally chain stitch all quadra inversely proportional relationship. The stronger transmitter works, the lower the activity of the receiver. Conversely, the weaker become the impulses coming from the transmitter, the receiver is more activated. Thus, the internal clash of right-and levoorientirovannyh processes enable or disable deployment speed quadra programs that provide a total displacement mechanism obsolete communicative paradigm of its neighbor-rival.
</p><p>implementers supersede social arena conditioner in his strength and organization. Preparatory give rise to vague and distant goal, but can not do anything for their implementation. To overcome passivity and primitive interests of the majority of the population, need energy and ability to get people to face the force of the new. To agitate and organize the masses can only second quadra. Preparatory just come to Voplotitelyam themselves at the service to be able to stably organized and doing things you love.
</p><p>Vibrators displace implementers its pluralism and efficiency. Suppress or even eliminate dissent, why so eager second quadra, it is impossible in principle. Removing bounding boxes can be due to natural competition and selfishness of people achieve better meet the needs of society. This makes the third quadra, shifting the focus from coercion on the material interest. Just buy vibrators implementers than make split their once powerful ranks.
</p><p>Perfector coming to replace vibrator being pushed by their humanity and quality of life. In an era vibrating badly people get tired of instability, corruption of politicians, low-quality goods, the pursuit of short-term profit. Good attitude to man can do more than financial reward. Reliance on healthy tradition, confidence in the future - that's what your change Vibrators liberalism and commercialism.
</p><p>Preparatory, vospryanuvshie spirit between perfectionism take over the baton from the hands of the fourth thanks to its quadra intellectualism and enthusiasm. Conservatism and traditionalism stable, unfortunately, quite easily bored, people want variety and strangeness. Grounding and pessimism tired of life perfectors not compete with the enthusiasm and intelligent search preparer.
</p><p>That's so multifaceted, but at the same time making its way purposefully quadra relay, each type is indispensable contribution to the overall process. Many benefits for themselves would benefit the intellectual forces of society, if taken into account in its activities quadra system timing. Constructible where you started and where its development are now, think and vote on new habits and aspirations of their friends and enemies. This will help you to understand what awaits you in the future, as well as, perhaps, make your way to the goal shorter.
