<p><b>Black (extroverted) ethics <a href="index.php@title=Extroverted_ethics.html" title="Extroverted ethics"><img alt="Fe" src="images/2/20/Symbol_e.gif" width="12" height="12" /></a></b>
</p><p>Perceives information about processes taking place in objects — first of all, emotional processes that are taking place in people, their excitation or subduedness, and their moods. This perceptual element implies the ability to know what excites people, and what suppresses them. It defines a person's ability or inability to control his emotional state, and also the emotional states of other people.
</p><p>When this element is in the leading position, the individual has the innate ability to induce or convey his moods to others and energize people with his emotions. He is able to activate the psychological/spiritual lives of other people and their emotional readiness for action. You might say that such a person has the ability to infect others with his moods and tends to impose on others the emotional states that he considers beneficial for their life activities.
</p><p>What people usually call emotions or a person's display of emotions is neither more nor less than a form of letting out this internal excitation directly, almost without expending it in muscle activity. A cheerful person who laughs releases an emotional charge and inner excitation through certain movements of the muscles of the face and body. This might be a means for reducing overexcitement, when inner exertion cannot be used for the activity it was intended for. But it can also be a conscious method of conveying one's excitement/agitation to others — inducing one's internal excitement/agitation in the psyches of other people. Anger, for example, is also a way of reducing overexcitement, but it is usually directed not at arousing others emotionally, but at emotionally suppressing and depleting them, at lowering their activity level, or at strictly channeling their activity.

<p><b>Extroverted ethics</b> (<a href="index.php@title=Extroverted_ethics.html" title="Extroverted ethics"><img alt="Fe" src="images/2/20/Symbol_e.gif" width="12" height="12" /></a>) is an <a href="index.php@title=Extroverted.html" title="Extroverted">extroverted</a>, <a href="index.php@title=Rational.html" title="Rational" class="mw-redirect">rational</a>, and <a href="index.php@title=Dynamic.html" title="Dynamic" class="mw-redirect">dynamic</a> <a href="index.php@title=Information_element.html" title="Information element" class="mw-redirect">information element</a>. It is also called <b>Fe</b>, <b>E</b>, the <b>ethics of emotions</b>, or <b>black ethics</b>.
</p><p>Fe is generally associated with the ability to recognize and convey (i.e. make others experience) passions, moods, and emotional states, generate excitement, liveliness, and feelings, get emotionally involved in activities and emotionally involve others, recognize and describe emotional interaction between people and groups, and build a sense of community and emotional unity.
</p><p>Types that value Fe like creating a visible atmosphere of camaraderie with other people. They enjoy a loose atmosphere where anything goes, where people don't have to watch too carefully what they say for fear of offending others. This means these types try not to be too thin-skinned, taking jokes with a grain of salt. However, they are very conscious of the fact that the way something is said is very important to how it will be received, so they tend to add emphasis, embellishments, and exaggerations here and there to keep people engaged. The best way to say something is highly dependent on the situation and the implied purpose of the exchange, so of course levity is not appropriate in some situations.
</p><p>Even after explosive arguments, these types find it hard to hold grudges, and can tolerate people they in principle don't like, as long as the situation is primarily social and doesn't require too close contact. They prefer misgivings to be out in the open; they believe that the silent treatment is one of the worst things you can do to a person, and only aggravates the underlying problem.

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="as_a_base_.281st.29_function_.28ESE_and_EIE.29"> <a href="index.php@title=Extroverted_ethics.html" title="Extroverted ethics"><img alt="Fe" src="images/2/20/Symbol_e.gif" width="12" height="12" /></a> as a <a href="index.php@title=Base_function.html" title="Base function" class="mw-redirect">base</a> (1st) function (<a href="index.php@title=ESE.html" title="ESE" class="mw-redirect">ESE</a> and <a href="index.php@title=EIE.html" title="EIE" class="mw-redirect">EIE</a>)</span></h3>
<p>The individual is always in tune to the emotional flow surrounding him, and responds to it spontaneously and directly. He seeks out and creates activities where people are totally engaged in what they are doing. Something's value is directly tied to how much it arouses his or another's passion.
</p><p>He is highly proactive about steering the emotional flow in the direction he himself considers ideal to a given situation. He may, for example, try to cheer people with jokes if he sees that they are too gloomy or, conversely, to get people to be serious and concentrated if they are too carefree during a crisis situation. Nevertheless, he believes emotions should be expressed as honestly as possible. 
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="as_a_creative_.282nd.29_function_.28SEI_and_IEI.29"> <a href="index.php@title=Extroverted_ethics.html" title="Extroverted ethics"><img alt="Fe" src="images/2/20/Symbol_e.gif" width="12" height="12" /></a> as a <a href="index.php@title=Creative_function.html" title="Creative function" class="mw-redirect">creative</a> (2nd) function (<a href="index.php@title=SEI.html" title="SEI" class="mw-redirect">SEI</a> and <a href="index.php@title=IEI.html" title="IEI" class="mw-redirect">IEI</a>) </span></h3>
<p>The person is sensitive to the emotional atmosphere around him, either from an individual, or a group, or even from inanimate objects such as the landscape, the state of the physical environment he happens to be in, or his own emotional associations with the place or people around him. A positive emotional atmophere is essential for his sense of well being and inner peace, and he either tries to promote it himself by directly influencing it around him, or by simply moving away from the environment or the people causing a negative emotional environment in his view.
</p><p>For the <a href="index.php@title=SEI.html" title="SEI" class="mw-redirect">SEI</a>, this takes an on-the-spot aspect and is reflected in cracking jokes, trying to make people laugh, or simply moving away from people he perceives as affecting him negatively. For the <a href="index.php@title=IEI.html" title="IEI" class="mw-redirect">IEI</a>, this takes a longer-term perspective; so the focus, rather than being on the immediate emotional environment, is on the perceived longer-term emotional state of others towards the individual, and is reflected in trying to be on good terms with those he interacts with or seeking distance or protection from, or "preventively" attacking, those he sees as irremediably hostile emotionally. 
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="as_a_role_.283rd.29_function_.28LIE_and_LSE.29"> <a href="index.php@title=Extroverted_ethics.html" title="Extroverted ethics"><img alt="Fe" src="images/2/20/Symbol_e.gif" width="12" height="12" /></a> as a <a href="index.php@title=Role_function.html" title="Role function" class="mw-redirect">role</a> (3rd) function (<a href="index.php@title=LIE.html" title="LIE" class="mw-redirect">LIE</a> and <a href="index.php@title=LSE.html" title="LSE" class="mw-redirect">LSE</a>) </span></h3>
<p>The individual makes an effort to adapt to the prevailing emotional atmosphere, especially in group situations, and tries to promote a positive emotional environment, as in making positive or witty remarks, in the presence of individuals he is already somewhat acquainted with and appreciates. Such efforts, however, are normally low-key and of short duration; it is difficult for him to display emotions more complex or intense than enthusiasm. He is essentially unable to participate in a group atmosphere where intense emotional expression as in loud laughing and mutual jokes are prevailing. The individual makes an effort to be aware of the need not to disrupt the prevailing emotional atmosphere but he does not succeed for any length of time if that would clash with his inner emotional state and private feelings about the other persons present. A typical example is the person who, in a group of people exchanging pleasantries and casual conversation, will occasionally correct erroneous statements made by others, in a way that can be perceived as annoying, despite otherwise making an effort to abide by the prevailing emotional atmosphere. 
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="as_a_vulnerable_.284th.29_function_.28ILI_and_SLI.29"> <a href="index.php@title=Extroverted_ethics.html" title="Extroverted ethics"><img alt="Fe" src="images/2/20/Symbol_e.gif" width="12" height="12" /></a> as a <a href="index.php@title=Vulnerable_function.html" title="Vulnerable function" class="mw-redirect">vulnerable</a> (4th) function (<a href="index.php@title=ILI.html" title="ILI" class="mw-redirect">ILI</a> and <a href="index.php@title=SLI.html" title="SLI" class="mw-redirect">SLI</a>) </span></h3>
<p>The individual tries hard to never let himself "come apart at the seams" emotionally or even let out strong feelings publicly, because displays of passion do not come naturally and make him feel self-consciousness and vulnerable to painful criticism. This makes the individual generally seem emotionally neutral and politely indifferent to excitement and agitation around him. The individual deeply dislikes attempts by others to get him to "cheer up" or "join the fun", especially in the context of group activities with loud emotional expression. 
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="as_a_suggestive_.285th.29_function_.28LII_and_LSI.29"> <a href="index.php@title=Extroverted_ethics.html" title="Extroverted ethics"><img alt="Fe" src="images/2/20/Symbol_e.gif" width="12" height="12" /></a> as a <a href="index.php@title=Suggestive_function.html" title="Suggestive function" class="mw-redirect">suggestive</a> (5th) function (<a href="index.php@title=LII.html" title="LII" class="mw-redirect">LII</a> and <a href="index.php@title=LSI.html" title="LSI" class="mw-redirect">LSI</a>) </span></h3>
<p>The individual often becomes engrossed in serious work, which leads him to neglect his complementary need for fun and emotional release. He also feels vulnerable expressing himself spontaneously in public, which allows bad emotions and stress to build up, leading to depression or sudden hostility. He enjoys being around people who make him feel comfortable expressing himself, and who can make every day new and exciting.
</p><p>Although he may present a hard exterior in the company of strangers, he is likely to not be serious at all with people who know him better. His behavior changes radically - a calm and serious structured person will suddenly become jovial and warm.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="as_a_mobilizing_.286th.29_function_.28ILE_and_SLE.29"> <a href="index.php@title=Extroverted_ethics.html" title="Extroverted ethics"><img alt="Fe" src="images/2/20/Symbol_e.gif" width="12" height="12" /></a> as a <a href="index.php@title=Mobilizing_function.html" title="Mobilizing function" class="mw-redirect">mobilizing</a> (6th) function (<a href="index.php@title=ILE.html" title="ILE" class="mw-redirect">ILE</a> and <a href="index.php@title=SLE.html" title="SLE" class="mw-redirect">SLE</a>) </span></h3>
<p>The individual longs for situations where people are having fun, laughing and joking, and feel emotionally free and spontaneous. However, he is generally unable to produce this atmosphere himself and uses other means to create situations where there is a good chance that others will take the emotional initiative and create a fun and emotionally stimulating atmosphere. Failure at such attempts are met with dismay, which the individual either hides or reacts to with frustration and annoyance. 
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="as_an_ignoring_.287th.29_function_.28ESI_and_EII.29"> <a href="index.php@title=Extroverted_ethics.html" title="Extroverted ethics"><img alt="Fe" src="images/2/20/Symbol_e.gif" width="12" height="12" /></a> as an <a href="index.php@title=Ignoring_function.html" title="Ignoring function" class="mw-redirect">ignoring</a> (7th) function (<a href="index.php@title=ESI.html" title="ESI" class="mw-redirect">ESI</a> and <a href="index.php@title=EII.html" title="EII" class="mw-redirect">EII</a>) </span></h3>
<p>The individual is perfectly able to integrate in a group emotional situations, such as people having fun and trading jokes, and sustain that for a long period of time. He is also usually adept at promoting such an atmosphere himself. However, he sees no point in doing so if his own inner emotional state does not prompt him towards that, especially if he does not feel as having positive private feelings towards the other people involved. He is aware of the need to keep a "polite façade" in certain social situations even in the presence of people he personally dislikes or during periods of negative inner emotions, but he refuses to actively attempt to integrate in, or promote, a positive external emotional atmosphere in such occasions. His disinclination for doing so increases along with his feelings of closeness with the individuals present. 
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="as_a_demonstrative_.288th.29_function_.28SEE_and_IEE.29"> <a href="index.php@title=Extroverted_ethics.html" title="Extroverted ethics"><img alt="Fe" src="images/2/20/Symbol_e.gif" width="12" height="12" /></a> as a <a href="index.php@title=Demonstrative_function.html" title="Demonstrative function" class="mw-redirect">demonstrative</a> (8th) function (<a href="index.php@title=SEE.html" title="SEE" class="mw-redirect">SEE</a> and <a href="index.php@title=IEE.html" title="IEE" class="mw-redirect">IEE</a>) </span></h3>
<p>The individual appreciates situations where people are enjoying a positive emotional atmosphere as in having fun and joking together, and is quite adept at creating them himself, but does not see creating or promoting them a top priority, nor does he actively look for people who maintain or need such an atmosphere; too high a focus on that is seen by the individual as overdone.

<p>The person lives through manifested relationships between people, their emotions and feelings, can make a favorable impression, create a positive atmosphere. Conservative in his estimates of how people relate to one another as well as to himself, as long as their attitude does not change - this may cause irritation for him. Categorically rejects those who treat others badly or act from base motives - for him such people are like a red rag to a bull. Attached to those in whose sympathies he is confident. Knows how to make people feel valued. Relations are perceived as something permanent and if a person has changed, he won't believe it - it's an area of conservation for him. The "good" should be "good" and "bad" - "bad". If they start behaving in a contrary manner, this irritates him. Therefore, he doesn't want to believe that relations are changing until he can no longer deny the facts, and even then he can try to blame someone else. Never deliberately exacerbates relations. Multiple stable relationships and personal connections form the foundation of his personality. Cannot spend time alone, if there is nobody to relate to, if nobody needs him, then he doesn't exist. The world around him should be good, kind, loving and caring. Sometimes he can search for a place among the religious sects that preach the principle "love each other". If they cannot achiever favorable disposition of others, this provokes anger and inferiority complex. Can be a zealot about such things as behavioral norms, that people in certain situations must demonstrate appropriate sense of the situation deviations from which can be annoying to him. Needs a public. Any situation is primarily a combination of relations.

<p>This person perceives and manipulates the feelings of others very finely, a skilled psychologist. He aims to be liked and sees his own purpose in this. Often likes non-communicative persons who need to be brought into contact, brings them "light". He is constantly involved in the process of ethical creation, can promise something just for the sake of improving relations with someone. Rarely spends time time alone, as wherever there are people he can make favorable impressions and create "good relations". Knows how to advertise himself and how to create the right mood in a group or in conversation with someone. Loves finding negative relations between people and changing them into positive, bringing people together. When there is no necessity to change anything on his personal front, may deliberately spoil relations so that he can mend them later i.e. find work for his creative function. Can impose his wishes onto others so that they look after them as if they were their own. The wishes and desires of others often become his focus as they allow him to improve relations towards himself. Likes risky, spontaneous relations. Knows how to persuade, ideal salesperson of goods and services if such is his vocation. He is best for elevating moods, for bringing groups together. But the inclination towards intrigues may cost him his position, as the fact that he is able to discreetly pass off "white" as "black" and make it out "unscathed" sooner or later becomes apparent if this happens too often.

<p>For this person it is important that everyone is positively predisposed towards him. He does not like ambiguity in this matter and will strive to clarify the situation: "Lets get this straight - do you respect me or not?" Even small changes can bring about these clarification attempts: different facial expression, gaze, and so on. Often with age he becomes a good psychologists as it allows him to keep up his self-esteem. Fixed on the attitude of certain people and ignores the "public opinion". Very fond of social recognition: honor, glory, respect, diplomas, regalia, etc. For the sake of good relations can even work for free. Can offer to help out of sense of camaraderie. If there is someone in his surrounding who shows negative feelings towards him, it decreases his self-esteem. In active defense, he will try to win the good attitude of this person at any cost, in passive defense, on the contrary, may admit to behaving poorly. If positive relations do not exist, he can try to fix them at any price, or conversely, fall into avoidance upon realizing the impossibility of changing anything. Fond of flattery, is ready to support any opinion as well as come to compromise only to keep the positive predisposition towards himself. If he does not agree with someone, can conduct conversation very diplomatically. Communicating with people of this type one can feel internal tension associated with fear of evoking negative response. Often they will think ten times before saying anything, as if it is an important task. Move up the career ladder often due to their ability to be considerate of others.

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Fe_as_suggestive_function_in_LSI_.28ISTj.3B_Maxim_Gorky.29_and_LII_.28INTj.3B_Robespierre.29">Fe as suggestive function in LSI (ISTj; Maxim Gorky) and LII (INTj; Robespierre)</span></h3>
<p>Tries to find a place where he is treated well by everybody. If someone expresses negative feelings towards him (for example, in a domestic fight his wife says, "I hate you"), then he takes this literally and tries to get out of there immediately and find another place where he is treated better. Therefore, they find it extremely difficult to be in places where they do not know how others are predisposed towards them. Appearance of someone who readily welcomes them is perceived as "the appearance of Christ to the people." Very suggestible when someone tells him about what relations exist between people. He likes positive emotions of other people, becomes as if charged up by them. Moves in overall direction of prevailing positive tone in emotions and avoids places with negative emotional charge. He does not like intrigue and gossip, feels uneasy in such situations since here he can easily fall victim and be put at a disadvantage. Therefore, he is critical of those who are not direct in communication, who speak in private and not openly, is suspicious of this. Relations between people should always be open, honest, and kind. What is said about one's relations should coincide with one's actions, and if not - then something is wrong. Saying that you love a person it should be demonstrated in action as well, and if your words are not visible - then they are not true. Very suspicious about predisposition of others towards him, suspects some kind of conspiracy. Even if suspicions are due to small detail, he either immediately tries to break off relations with a person or to exclude his or her from his inner circle, reducing contact with them to a minimum. Because of this he can considered a defector - if he finds people who treat him better he may ally with them, finding this a substantial enough argument to change sides. May fall victim to sycophancy.
