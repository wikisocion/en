<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Description_by_V._Meged_and_A._Ovcharov">Description by V. Meged and A. Ovcharov</span></h3>
<p><b>Appearance</b>
</p><p>The ethical subtype usually makes an impression of a modest, gentle, soft person, but in his soul he is very principled, demanding, and distrustful. It is difficult to make him change his mind. Can be very stubborn and intractable. Sensitive, prudish, dislikes imposing his company. Internally highly critical and applies his high ethical standards to other people, though may not openly voice this. If his principles are touched, he can suddenly show his character, becoming sharp and uncompromising. Hardworking and practical. At work he is responsible and painstaking. Shows good manners, tries to be gracious and refined. Dresses with taste, though somewhat monotonously. His gaze is soft, at times frightened, and testing.

He is constantly analyzing actions of other people and condemning any violations of moral and ethical norms. However, he tries to be more tolerant towards others and doesn't immediately express his opinions if they are negative. Very observant: readily notices personal flaws and capabilities of other people. Remembers the mistakes of others for a long time, and if opportunity presents itself can resort to his "personal files". May idealize those he is sympathetic towards from a distance. Demonstrates his attitude not only by words but also by actions.
</p><p>This is a person of duty. Does not spare his time and effort for upkeep of order and stability at work. Does his work meticulously and thoroughly, overcoming any obstacles that arise on the way. Does not put off and delay everyday tasks and chores until later. Makes himself to do work that is uninteresting but necessary. Helps out others with work that they cannot cope with by the deadlines. Very conscientious, aware of his obligations, and responsible person, but prefers to share responsibility with others. Inclined to sit at work late, trying to finish up everything. Accurately maintains records. 
</p><p>Careful, guarded and distrustful, afraid of making mistakes and letting down others. Painfully endures injustice and critical remarks regarding his abilities. Needs praise and compliments, though usually he does not show this. Tries to exercise foresight in everything, so that any unexpected events don't catch him by surprise. Prefers to plan for future activities. Prepares for everything in advance, is punctual and usually does not run late. 
</p><p>Does not give any promises if he is unsure that he can fulfill them. Shy and indecisive, dislikes imposing anything on strangers. Appreciates comfort, both at his workplace and in relationships. Expresses his attitude not so much by words, as by the tone of his voice and look. 
</p><p>Stable and in his habits, interests and affections. Yielding in relations, may put aside his own affairs to solve problems of his partner. Very impressionable and vulnerable, but shares his sufferings only with his close ones. Values friendship and does not forgive betrayal. Considerate and courteous. Modest and undemonstrative, tries not to stand out. Dresses simply, but with good taste.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Description_by_Victor_Gulenko">Description by Victor Gulenko</span></h3>
<p>Delicate and sensitive in nature. A good judge of character and a reliable friend. Capable of coming to a compromise. With his softness and ease of interaction he sometimes resembles an SEI. This subtype is often a better implementer than an organizer. It's important to him how others regard him, their opinions of him. Attentive, caring, and sensitive. Good with small children. Can realize himself in applied arts and cultural work. Outward appearance is modest. He rarely follows fashion and prefers a freer style.
</p>

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Description_by_V._Meged_and_A._Ovcharov_2">Description by V. Meged and A. Ovcharov</span></h3>
<p><b>Appearance</b>
</p><p>The sensory subtype is quite strict, critical, and ironic. Categorical in conclusions and uncompromising in decisions. Internally sensitive and emotional, but tries to appear as strong, cold, self-assured person. Serious, guarded, and private. Conservative in his tastes and habits. Diligent in work, though sometimes he lacks in attention and perseverance to complete his assignments. At times seems unapproachable, arrogant, and prickly. His gaze is piercing. His face sometimes assumes a guarded expression. Well-wishing and attentive, but keeps at a distance from others. Quite undemonstrative. Dislikes it when his appearance is inspected; afraid of external evaluations. Takes care of his looks, dresses elegantly, with taste and a bit of strictness. If he is confident in his appearance, may allow himself to wear additional accessories. His gait is often hammering.
</p><p><b>Character</b> 
</p><p>Stubborn, firm, and uncompromising in matters that are of importance to him. Strong-willed and enduring. Industrious and venturesome. Energetic and quick in handling practical matters. Can do several things at once, showing extraordinary work ethic and efficiency. From time to time, needs an emotional discharge. Difficult life situations invigorate him and stimulate him to search for quick solutions and exits out of current circumstances. With difficulty takes the initiative in making new acquaintances and establishing new contacts, but usually takes the first steps in breaking off relations that have run their course. Observant and clever, at the right time can hit the weakest spot of his opponent. To good and poor treatment answers with the same. Has a tendency to divide people into "his own" and "others". 
</p><p>Seems somewhat inaccessible, vigilant, and alert. Dislikes it when someone puts his qualities to an evaluation because internally he is not fully confident in himself. Intolerant of those who are lazy, slovenly, and disingenuous. Does not forgive rudeness and tactlessness, which may even serve as a reason to break up relations for him. In a company of unfamiliar or unpleasant people, he feels constrained and may choose to leave quietly. Does not like unexpected visitors, quickly becomes tired of them. At times he is overly distrustful and suspicious of others. 
</p><p>In conversation with people tries to determine their abilities and possibilities for future practical application in some area. Tries to evaluate people objectively, regardless of his sympathies for them. Often possesses good administrative skills. In his decisions seeks to rely on factual information. 
</p><p>In a circle of close people, he is usually talkative, makes jokes, sometimes asks tricky questions, inclined to play pranks and set up ruses; attempts to entertain others. Subordinates his emotions to the situation: he is cheerful among those who are cheerful and serious among those who are serious. Defends and upholds ethical standards. Selflessly protects his own interests and interest of people who are close to him. Able to make others subjugate to his will. In difficult situations, readily lends his help to others and offers his services. Tries not to show his anger and spite openly, but not everyone can withstand his penetrating, prickly gaze. 
</p><p>Places high demands on himself. Quickly adapts to new circumstances if he finds them favorable. Poorly tolerates ambivalence and hesitation. Finds it difficult to wait for resolution of important for him questions. Often fluctuates in selection of a goal, but at a critical moment he can make the right decision. Poorly feels the progression of time; due to this, grows nervous getting ready for anything, feels anxious that he won't make it on time. Feels worried concerning upcoming changes, for example, when he has to take a trip. Cherishes stability, supports conventions of his own circle. Somewhat suspicious and skeptical. 
</p><p>A good economist, able to efficiently handle his finances, dislikes being in debt. Easily takes the initiative in concrete and practical activities, can even be assertive and imposing. Intolerant of irresponsibility and disorganization. Often possesses a developed aesthetic taste and dresses originally. Clean and neat, and demands the same from others. Finds it difficult to discern individual capabilities and hidden motives of others; due to this can have problems with his work colleagues, family members and children.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Description_by_Victor_Gulenko_2">Description by Victor Gulenko</span></h3>
<p>This is a person of duty, very active and enduring. Characterized by expansionism within a small circle. Can be aggressive if he's not agreed with. In conflict situations is never the first to seek reconciliation. Gravitates to administrative roles. May become managers of medium-sized groups, keeping discipline and order, and applying sanctions to those who are at fault. Often is quite forthright and blunt. Shows his attitude with an incinerating look. Businesslike and purposeful. Can give a rebuff to those who create illegal structures, as they easily recognize the seeds of such activities. Prefer prestigious style in clothing, sometimes even bright but not ostentatious tones.
