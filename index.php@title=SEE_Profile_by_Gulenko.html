In situations when he is well-informed, he will cite different quotes and facts by this demonstrating his erudition.
</p><p>Poorly discerns what needs to be done now and what can be postponed until later. Doesn't explain the reasons for his actions. Often makes off-topic comments. Cannot keep up order himself, and will violently protest if he is being subjected to any strict order or regulations. When he needs information, prefers to interact and deal with people face-to-face rather than read manuals and instructions.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Detailed_description"> Detailed description </span></h2>
<p>SEE is perceptive of the balance of power. He quickly detects who is strong and who is weak, who can be pushed around and whom it's better not to touch. Looks for weak spots in people who are close to him. Exerting pressure on these points, he is able to change their behavior in a way that is most favorable for him. He himself is not susceptible to such manner of pressuring, will skillfully dodge it. Knows how to stand up for himself. Reacts boisterously when his freedom and opportunities are being limited. Orders around those who are less resolute and decisive and less confident in themselves. With a stronger partner talks on equal terms. Always finds a way to draw attention to himself.
</p><p>SEE is very discerning of the system of relationships that exist between people. He knows how to tell someone precisely that which this person wants to hear from him. However, he does not rush to fulfill his promises if he doesn't feel a particular need in this. Balances between interests of the opposing groups, successfully negotiating and bargaining. If it's in his interests, he easily reconciles with former adversaries. Knows how to mend and improve previously broken relations. However, most often he plays on negative relations and dislikes rather than on sympathies and positive relationships. He finds it difficult to break relations that have run their course. Instead he will let a person know indirectly that he or she is no longer interesting to him. Dislikes allowing people too close to himself, because he feels that this imposes certain obligations on him. Easily strikes up acquaintances and new contacts and feels better and more confident in groups of people rather than alone in everyday environment.
</p><p>Presents himself as an original, unusual personality which won't be fitted into any frameworks. Inclined to contrast himself with others around him. Often can maintain a conversation on any topic, little by little demonstrating that he is knowledgeable on a wide variety of topics. Captures new information quickly, but mostly on the surface. Periodically he is taken by reflections and contemplations, during which time he becomes self-absorbed. At such times, it seems to him that people do not perceive him as he really is. Quite capricious, moody and choosy. Will often highlight his broad potential, his opportunities and great prospects. Often argues and does not readily agree, will defend his point of view and values on principle.
</p><p>Dislikes it when others don't take his arguments and conclusions on a given situation or problem into consideration. Those who ignore his remarks he will consider to be his opponents. Dependent on the established order within the area where he lives or works. May complain about lack of organization and disorder, although won't enforce it himself, since he doesn't want to ruin his relations and his actions are often not methodical. He only responds to the already established hierarchy. With a person he communicates either from a lower position, as a subordinate, or from a higher position, as their superior. With subordinates he is not ceremonious. Cannot tolerate people around himself whom he dislikes, does everything in his abilities in order to remove them. Doesn't have any system of action.
</p><p>Feels enlivened and inspired when his time is taken up by matters. Otherwise, having an excess of time, may lead a sedentary, lazy lifestyle, despairing and criticizing everything. He enjoys constant change, development, contrariness. Often wants to leave for somewhere else and completely change his situation. Tries to impose time that is most convenient to him. Sometimes he is hurrying and rushing others, while at others times he slows down and strongly inhibits any quick decisions. If he needs to, will always find something to pick on. Likes when he is being persuaded, approached at some distance, told many examples and instructive stories from the past.
</p><p>His mood depends on how well things are going for him. To improve his emotional state, offer him some profitable or beneficial activity. Has an inclination to show generosity, up to extravagance, when his mood is elevated, and frugality and stinginess when he is emotionally depressed. In any case, emotions and personal relations are the most important thing for him. He cannot work if the occupation is uninteresting to him. Any activity or undertaking can turn into entertainment, make it feel like a show. Becomes very nervous and angry, if he is outdone in business or if rewards and material benefits have been distributed in a way that he thinks he is getting less than others. He can start a quarrel over this.
</p><p>Hates it when someone violates his peace and relaxation. Concerns very much for his financial and physical well-being. Will not allow anything to the detriment of his own leisure. Looks after cleanliness and the standards of hygiene. Squeamish. Criticizes the quality of products and value of goods if in his opinion they are not on par. Feels comfortable with his body and physiological processes. He is distinguished by his personal aesthetic taste, which doesn't always coincide which the accepted tastes. When taking trips out to nature, he is cautious, won't venture first to an unknown location. Conservative in his habits and home life. Sometimes falls to an extreme and becomes indifference of his own appearance.
</p><p>His productivity at work is highly dependent on his mood. When he is in high spirits, he will undertake even hard work, but when he is not in the mood, then even very important work will remain undone. Energetic in carrying out those tasks that can be done immediately. If there is no quick returns, and ahead lies a lot of hard work, he soon cools down and looks for another course of action. Excitement and emotional arousal increase his efficiency. Around himself he creates an atmosphere of a celebration, a feast. Best at resolving his problems and issues by informal means. Dissipates his energy in various directions: deals with several things at once, easily switching from one to another. If the number of his interests continues to grow, then his efficiency falls.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Manner_of_communication"> Manner of communication </span></h2>
<p>The main trait that identifies an SEE in communication - is a turbulent reaction when he is being subordinated to rules that limit his concrete activities. In such cases, the SEE may behave in a very assertive and bold way. The SEE becomes irritated when he or she is being criticized for whims, illogical actions, when someone tries to figure out motivations for his behavior. Very self-confident, doesn't take logical arguments into account. In interaction, the SEE readily displays his or her feelings. Openly expresses personal sympathies and antipathies. SEE's feelings are very flexible and mutable. He can quarrel with a person and leave slamming the door, but after some time he can come back and reconcile, as if nothing has happened. From time to time, the SEE enters periods of relaxation and meditation. Likes to feel sad at such times, to complain that he is not understood, that in reality he is not how he seems to others. In such moments his gaze looks off into the distance, his eyes become shrouded by a haze and cloudy. In company, aims to bring out people's positive emotions.

Often has a habit of talking on the phone for a long time. In a circle of friends, transfers his mood onto others. If he's in a bad mood, it's bad for everyone, if he is merry and cheerful, he can be up to anything.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Features_of_behavior"> Features of behavior </span></h2>
<p>The main feature of SEE's behavior that becomes apparent after some time - is the ability to manipulate people's feelings. When he needs it, he is always able to turn people's attention to himself. Does this openly, without any embarrassment. Usually has a large number of acquaintances. The SEE doesn't always want to break up relations that have exhausted themselves and become boring, thus his circle of acquaintances is always expanding.

<p>A SEE is noticeable in by his figure and facial features. Often has a full, voluminous in all parts of the body, figure. This is especially true for women. Due to this, the SEE gives of an impression of a certain "uncontrollable" mass. Looking at SEE's face, the first thing that draws attention is a soft, sometimes maudlin mouth, as well as nervous lips, the corners of which are often dropped down. Because of this, in mature age, lateral vertical folds of skin form around his mouth. The shape of SEE's face is commonly oval, smooth, without protruding parts. Eyes are mobile, agile, skimming along the surface of people and objects, assessing  and scanning space. The eyes are usually not very deep set. Sometimes the lower portion of his face has more weight than the upper portion. Two subtypes of SEE - <a href="index.php@title=SEE_subtypes.html" title="SEE subtypes">sensing and ethical</a> - are distinguished by the nature of their movements and their gait. The <a href="index.php@title=SEE_subtypes.html" title="SEE subtypes">ethical subtype</a> of SEE is often quick, restless, daring. The <a href="index.php@title=SEE_subtypes.html" title="SEE subtypes">sensory subtype</a> is calm, measured, moves with confidence. Watching the movements of sensory subtype for some time, an impression might arise of a "viscous, stringy mass", a "rolling ball of mercury". SEE's clothing usually distinguishes his or her from the surrounding people. The SEE watches fashion, but one cannot say that he mindlessly copies it. Dresses in a way to draw the attention of others. Always confident in his appearance, so sometimes allows himself to dress in the most original outfits that immediately catch the eye (especially true for women of this type).

</li></ul>

</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="As_a_supervisor"> As a supervisor </span></h2>
<p>Flexibility, diplomacy, and skillful use of opposing individuals or sides - are the main qualities of SEE. Such qualities are present in a strong person, who knows how to manipulate their own emotions and the emotions of other people. This type is very practical. He or she is able to gain the confidence and to show their own necessity. Quickly adapts to any social setting and easily finds a comfortable niche within it for themselves.
</p><p>Supervisor-manipulator
The manager of this type is able to skillfully manipulate emotional relationships and thus prudently move towards his goal. These are very enterprising people who tend towards leadership within their chosen field. As a rule, they are able to quickly climb the career ladder. Their intellectual and other psychological resources are directed primarily at ensuring their own safety, retention of their work status and well-being. They tend to view their subordinates as a means in the struggle for power.
</p><p>This sociotype quickly orients in present situation and easily finds ways to solve the challenges of today. His system behavior is built in accordance with the present situation (developed situational extraverted logic allows the SEE to respond appropriately to the given circumstances). The form of his reactions to any event largely depends on his emotional perception. He does not like to subject his activities and his ways of relating to other people to some once and for all specified rules. According to him, there are different "rules" that can be selected depending on the circumstances, psychological and employment status of the person, and the evaluation of his real and potential capabilities. Not the last place in these assessments play the considerations of usefulness and personal gains and benefits. If the SEE believes that he doesn't need a person as his partner, he can easily break off relations with him, not considering any logical arguments and conventionally accepted rules of behavior.
</p><p>The "Politician" takes the nuances of relationships into account. He knows the strengths and weakness of his partner or an employee. Remembers his errors and blunders, and can put them to use at any time in order to draw the person into his plans. Has conscious control of his emotions and uses them as a tool of exerting influence on other people. Knows how to command, how to exert volitional pressure on others. But can also successfully use the method of persuasion.
</p><p>A characteristic trait of the "Politician" as a manger or leader - is the desire to expand his influence in breadth. Tries to get rid of people who question the expediency of his actions and the rationality of his decisions. Painfully endures criticism in his address. If such a person is the head of a small group, this is fraught with saturation of work atmosphere with stormy, often negative emotions, and disruptions in the rhythm of work. In a big group, such emotional manifestations will occur to a much lesser extent, in some cases even be useful, for example, when an organization is on the verge of undergoing great changes.
</p><p>Main characteristics:
</p>
<ul><li> Inclined to solving tactical problems.
</li><li> Is able to adequately express themselves in the role of a frontal leader.
</li><li> Method of establishing business contacts is oriented as subjective factors.
</li><li> The form of business activity has a strong emotional component; it is focused on protection of existing gains and achievements.
</li><li> The system of interaction with people implies an atmosphere of free uninhibited communication, establishment of collegiality.
</li><li> Has competing type of behavior with elements of compromising type.
</li><li> Achieves great results through episodically manifested boisterous activity and skillful manipulation of people.
</li><li> Can show an active denial of an ethical approach in business.
</li><li> Motives and purpose: self-interest, profit, and success of his organization at all costs.
</li><li> Attitude towards the law: it is desirable to overcome legal barriers, but without criminal risks.
</li><li> Strategy: full freedom of management; maximally possible exploitation of human capabilities.
</li></ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Working_conditions"> Working conditions </span></h2>
<p>The impetus that drives the SEE is achievement of high level of material and ethical status within a group. The SEE needs to look effective, no worse than others, so he expends a lot of effort and money to create an image of a successful person. With this he strives that the things that surround him are fashionable, expensive, as high-quality as possible. The SEE can flexibly manipulate relationships with other people, reducing or increasing the distance, according to the situation, depending on whether the person is needed as a business partner, his status in society (system of D. Carnegie). Tends to surround himself with influential people. In a conversation with pleasure mentions friends who have weight in society. For this reason, when communicating with an SEE, it is recommended to show the utmost politeness and tact, showing that you are considerate of SEE's status. If possible, show that you are also doing well in life (it can be done with a spectacular clothing, business cards, stationery objects, etc.). Remember that the SEE makes judgments about you first of all basing on your external data. If the SEE is your subordinate, do not use him or her for boring sedentary jobs that require diligence and punctuality. SEE's also are not quite successful in learning and adopting new technologies and new working methods. They perform best when they are given various supply-related and representational type work, that provides the SEE with varied and interesting social contacts. Such subordinates poorly tolerate criticism of their actions. Thus if you need to make a remark, do so in private in careful form (it is best to use "Aesop's language" - give some kind of exemplary analogous situation, giving the SEE an opportunity to make conclusions for himself). Also remember that people of this type almost don't plan their actions and poorly evaluate the extent of initial risk. Therefore, if you develop a strategy and methodology of future course of action and allow the SEE to implement it - this will be optimal both for him and for you. He will also be grateful is you warn him about possible risks and dangers.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Recommendations_for_self-improvement"> Recommendations for self-improvement </span></h2>
<p>Your strong traits - are decisiveness and resourcefulness. Your type of personality often has a tendency towards leadership. You are not afraid to take the initiative in managing people for solution of large problems. You always believe in yourself.
</p><p>You know how to stand up for yourself and how to defend your authority from unjust attacks. You actively take care of everyday needs of your loved ones to ensure a good standard of living for them.
</p><p>With your business and organizational skills you attract other people's attention to yourself. You have a large circle of acquaintances, among whom you are granted respect and trust. You have a good perception of work/business capabilities of other people, and know how to properly use them in the interests of business or a project.
</p><p>Your sensitivity and charm allow you to gain friends and to win the sympathy of others. Your many friends and acquaintances are willing to do much for you.
</p><p>In life you experience difficulties due to the fact that within the flow of activities, work, chores, and projects that you're engaged with, you cannot always separate the primary from the secondary. This ultimately leads to waste of strengths and efforts, tiredness and fatigue.
</p><p>You need to develop perseverance and patience in yourself. Try to bring everything that you have started to its finish before you start on something new. Do not try to solve everything immediately, in one fell swoop. Be consistent and use different ways and approaches to solving difficult problems.
</p><p>Spend more time on self-development and self-education. Raise the level of your theoretical understanding. This will allow you to avoid accusations of incompetence and support your authority.
</p><p>Concentrate your attention on big issues. Do not waste your energy on minor things and arguments over trifles.
</p><p>Do not make hasty decisions. Try to analyze the situation as a whole before springing to action.
</p><p>Be more objective in assessing merits of other people. Subjectivity in your estimates may lead to unwanted conflict situations in a work-group or a team.
</p><p>Your other problem is that you are too sensitive to criticism. Being vulnerable and touchy, you react badly to innocuous remarks, which complicates your relationships with other people.
</p><p>You have a tendency towards over-valuation of your own physical and mental abilities. Try to be more critical in evaluating your own potential, because over-valuation of your own strengths and capabilities can lead you to a nervous and physical weakening and exhaustion.
</p><p>Be more selective in your acquaintances to minimize the risk of being compromised. 
</p><p>Nurture temperance in your desires. Remember that you cannot grasp the immense and un-graspable. To avoid feelings of guilt and remorse, try not to lose your sense of personal dignity even in the interests of your work or business.
