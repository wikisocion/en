</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Manner_of_communication"> Manner of communication </span></h2>
<p>The most characteristic feature of ESE's manner of communication - is heightened expressive emotionality. He likes to talk of something emotionally, with details. One of his favorite topics of conversation - is art. Talks about the plots of movies, plays, and books. His favorite movie or performance he may go to watch several times. In interaction this sociotype is easily determined by the expression of negative emotions. Periodically, the ESE openly expresses his indignation, often over minor reasons. He rapidly flares up in temper, but calms down just as quickly. This show of emotions cannot be explained by objective logic: from some detail he can create a drama, but at the same time not notice an almost direct insult. In a conversation, pays much attention to ethics, good manners. Likes to give norms ethical evaluations, to analyze who acted well and who acted poorly. Tracks that the courtesy norms are being followed. If people don't follow ethical norms of interaction, the ESE puts pressure on them by means of negative emotions. Because of this, he may be viewed as a scandalous, quarrelsome person. It's not easy to get along with him. For most people he proves to be too demanding, too linear and straightforward. Explains his opinions in detail, several times, asking his companion whether he or she has understood him. With this he might offend his listeners, who may think that he regards them as stupid. The ESE likes to talk about his social connections, contacts, and acquaintances. Easily creates them thanks to his sociable and friendly nature towards his conversation companions. With long-term constant relations requires selflessness from others.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Features_of_behavior"> Features of behavior </span></h2>
<p>In behavior the ESE is rather demonstrative. When he wants to achieve something, he lives into his role so much that he begins to believe in it himself. Although he can do much from cheer enthusiasm, in work and business he is typically practical and resourceful. Won't purchase just anything, tries to buy only the best. He is easily recognized by the following trait of behavior. Of all the sociotypes, the ESE is most prone to go back to the store and request replacement of defective goods or a refund. Skillfully combines and composes things together. Knows how to create a cozy environment seemingly out of nowhere. His possessions may not be the newest, but always of good quality. Tracks health and well-being of his loved ones. After visiting the doctor wants to make certain of diagnosis to figure out treatment for himself. Loves it when he is being helped, when someone is doing something around the house with their hands. What is important is not the result, but the fact that someone has decided to help him. Another quality that allows to identify this sociotype - is incredible hospitality. Tries to impress his guests with something unusual - to amaze and dazzle them. Gravitates towards social gatherings that feature food. While at this, he can be rather intrusive, not restrain himself to reasonable sense of measure, as in Ivan Krylov's fable "Demyanov's soup". ESE's uneconomical, useless waste of energy manifests itself in almost everything. He's always in a hurry, running somewhere, paying visits. Constantly over-loaded with things to do, tasks, chores, and activities, many of which can be put aside. Poorly tolerates criticism on this point, becomes offended.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Appearance"> Appearance </span></h2>
<p>The ESE can be determined by certain peculiarities of his appearance, and with this one should pay attention to the gait and movements. Details of ESE's face are usually small and proportional. In the face, one can notice a certain upward aspiration or upward impulse. ESE's posture is almost always straight. The figure is usually thin and composed. Fullness of figure is very rare. Among men of this type we haven't encountered excessive fullness of figure even once. In any case, the proportion of ESE's figure are stretched up. ESE's gait is also very characteristic and allows to make guesses concerning belonging to this sociotype. ESE's gait is always fast and very fussy. Such mobility is especially characteristic of men of this type. An impression is created of twitching, restlessness. With a <a href="index.php@title=ESE_subtypes.html" title="ESE subtypes">strong sensory component</a> this trait is much less pronounced. The ESE is also characterized by abrupt changes of facial expression. This is particularly evident in <a href="index.php@title=ESE_subtypes.html" title="ESE subtypes">ethical subtype</a>. After making some statements of logical nature, the ESE creates an impression of a person intensively pondering something. Pays sufficient attention to his clothes. By his selection of accessories it is clear that he wants to dress tastefully and harmoniously. Colors are usually picked in tone with each other. There are no outlying, striking details about his appearance. For women of this type liking of jewelry of characteristic, and not necessarily expensive items. Their decorations are always in harmony with their external appearance. In general, ESE's style of dressing gravitates towards being decorative, adorning of him or her. In picking clothing, the ESE always orients at his or her own taste. Puts on not what is fashionable, but that which compliments him. Tracks that the way he dresses complies with the functional goal of clothing: evening dress - for theater, sport style - for recreation. Notable disparities in clothing indicate that the person belongs to another sociotype.

Often he is successful in practical activities, but likes it when his efforts and his ingenuity are appreciated by others. Strives for stability, high material standard of living, and respect of his colleagues at work.
</p><p><b>Problem areas</b> <br />
ESE accumulates negative emotions, which he can hold in for a while. However, when these emotions build up, he can lose his temper and flare up, lose his temper, become upset, even fall sick. Cannot act without having some emotional rapport with his conversation partner, therefore finds it difficult to interact with people who don't in any way show their attitude towards what is happening. Not very economical. Doesn't always appropriately assess the value and usefulness of what he is doing. Vacillates for a long time before making an important decision or addressing a complex issue. Poorly feels how much time he has in reserve.

</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="As_a_supervisor"> As a supervisor </span></h2>
<p>Representatives of this sociotype are characterized by receptiveness of any ideas and initiatives. The ESE is energetic, adventurous, can demonstrate courage and audacity in risky situations. His nature is lively, ebullient - the soul of society; a fantasist, and sometimes - a braggart. The ESE has good command of emotions, which he uses as instruments for overcoming obstacles and to show his ingenuity. Dislikes postponing tasks and chores until later, especially when he sees immediate reward in them.
</p><p>Supervisor-companion<br />
Any companion is feels himself well in the atmosphere of a united, cohesive team that is moving towards one goal. Manager of the type "Enthusiast" aims to create at his workplace an atmosphere of cooperation and friendliness. He is inclined to identify himself with the organization, acutely feels its failures and rejoices for its successes.
</p><p>If the "Enthusiast" is psychologically weak, he will try to find in social structure in a place that would guarantee him safe existence. Those who are stronger, more confident in themselves, and assured of the strength of their position, show a marked tendency to dominate, while trying to maintain positive relations for as long as possible. Such leaders and managers are capable of making decisions quickly, and, "rolling up their sleeves", get to work without much delay. They encourage their subordinates to do the same. A representative of this sociotype can take up the most routine boring work if he sees it as necessary. May exhibit excessive fussiness fearing that he won't finish something.
</p><p>Due to their vigor and energetic drive, they can compete at very high levels. However, in conditions of harsh and rigid competition, they usually do not last. They don't see the potential of situations well and become "buried" in minor things and insignificant tasks. Thus, this sociotype is most suitable for leadership in narrow sectors of production.
</p><p>The "Enthusiast", despite his companionship-oriented nature, prefers that his instructions and requests get carried out without further discussion and critical remarks. Otherwise, conflict becomes a possibility. He is sufficiently cautious and prudent in relations to his superiors, although in some cases he can go for conflict and worsening of relations. Respects people who are independent, who can defend their opinions, who show character regardless of their position or rank.
</p><p>Main characteristics:
</p>
<ul><li> Can adequately express himself as a frontal leader. Capable of getting other people interested and involved.
</li><li> His method of establishing business contacts depends to a large extent on emotional and value assessments.
</li><li> Form of business activity is characterized by persistent achievement of goals by means of successfully bypassing obstacles and complications in relations.
</li><li> Builds his system of interaction with subordinates taking emotional interactions into account.
</li><li> Inclined to cooperate on basis of mutual benefit. In behavior may manifest elements of competing style of behavior.
</li><li> Achieves major results by his energy, drive, ability to motivate, and skillful manipulation of emotional relationships.
</li><li> Can manipulate ethical principles, orient and adapt to different "rules of the game".
</li><li> Motives and purpose: good intentions and self-benefiting motives. The goal - is attainment of profit (preferably within the framework of the law).
</li><li> Attitude towards the law: prefers to follow the letter of the law.
</li><li> Strategy: full freedom of management and control within the framework of the law.
</li></ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Working_conditions"> Working conditions </span></h2>
<p>The stimulus that drives the "Enthusiast" is achievement of high emotional status in a group. He wants to be good for all in order to have an opportunity to exert emotional impact. For this reason, he strives to become liked by his conversation partners, to help them in some way. Therefore, in interaction with the ESE you, first of all, will need to demonstrate a good attitude towards him, show that you certainly appreciate him and respect his opinions. Let him speak until he finishes, as the ESE is a <a href="index.php@title=EJ_temperament.html" title="EJ temperament">linear-assertive type</a>, and once he is in an excited emotional state you are unlikely to persuade him immediately (he needs some time to "cool off", to start to think soberly, to change his opinions or views). You can decrease the effect of his emotional pressuring by keeping yourself in a balanced, calm state and by requesting specifying details by asking leading questions. The ESE can do any, even uninteresting, work with good quality, if you can explain to him its usefulness and future potential of development of business. Since the ESE is a concretely thinking type, good pay and comfortable working conditions are not of small importance to him. Although he may assist you and work for some time simply because you're a "good person".

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Recommendations_for_self-improvement"> Recommendations for self-improvement </span></h2>
<p>In everyday life, you are an open, sociable, well-wishing person. For these qualities you are loved by people around you. You are well versed in the moods of other people, sympathize with the misfortunes of others, know how to feel their emotions. You won't leave a person in need or in trouble, try to assist those who have been wronged.
</p><p>You know how to bring pleasure to people. You are hospitable, generous, and caring. You know how to fill your free time in an interesting and active manner: go to movies, theaters, concerts, frequently visit friends, go to parties. Enjoy pleasant trips and travel. You don't mind spending time in the fun, loud, boisterous gathering of people, like holidays and dinners. You enjoy giving gifts, bringing joy to people.
</p><p>Your main problem - is the inability to dispose of your time in everyday affairs. You are often too hasty, restless, fidgety. Don't have enough time for anything. You get buried in endless tasks, chores, activities and concerns, often forgetting about the main, most important things.
</p><p>Try to appropriately plan your day. Reject any small, minor questions and issues, set them aside for later. Try to isolate the main core within a network of events, and to prognose its further development. Don't start doing everything at once, otherwise you won't be able to do it all in time. Remember - no one is safeguarded from surprises and unexpected happenings. 
</p><p>You can be too demanding and uncompromising in relation to family and friends, which serves as the cause of many disappointments in people. Once you feel deceived or disappointed by a person, you become suspicious and distrustful of everyone else. In a fit of emotion you can exaggerate the faults of others, present people in black color.
</p><p>Learn to balance you demands and wishes with the real life. Be tolerant of people, develop a more sympathetic attitude towards their shortcomings. Remember that there are no ideal people. With excessive emotional pressuring you can destroy harmony of relationships.
</p><p>Your other problem - is excessive expenditure of strength and material resources. Inability to control daily expenses doesn't allow you to create the necessary material reserves and savings. Save your strengths, don't over-exert yourself. Don't take up activities and projects that do not guarantee reliable returns.
</p><p>Forego countless meetings with relatives and friends, better take up household matters, to later carve out some time for leisure and relaxation. Try to keep order and organization in the house. Get rid of useless things, do not accumulate them. The less small, useless items you have, the easier it will be for you to find the necessary thing at the right time. Temper your hospitality. Don't be too intrusive with treats. Try to observe a sense of measure in all.
