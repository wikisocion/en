<i>We are given enjoyment not by what surrounds up, but by our attitude towards it.</i> – La Rochefoucauld
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>Love - is an individual creative work of human beings, thus it can be said that however many people there are, there are as many kinds of love. Yet, even in this most most mysterious and unfathomable field, there are some laws and patterns that allow us to distinguish 8 basic types of love.
</p><p>Of course, the forms of expression of feelings - are not yet love, but only the inclination towards one or another kind of it. Love - is a multifaceted feeling that can be expressed in different ways. For it are inherent: passion and tenderness, bliss and quiet tranquility, delight and anger, joy and anxiety, fear and even anger. Nonetheless, no matter how many colors and shapes may be in love, it is always striving for understanding, spiritual closeness, common occupations.
</p><p>Love - it's intimate and profound feeling, with the desire for commitment and constancy. It is characterized by the perception of the other person as a unique and inimitable personality, his idealization.
</p><p>This idealization not only dazzles loving, but, on the contrary, making it "seeing" as it allows to see what others do not see in your favorite. This feeling is not controlled by any mind or will, it can not be forced to trigger or suppress. Love gives rise to the desire to reciprocity, therefore stimulates a person to self-improvement and development of their best qualities, making it more meaningful, more interesting.
</p><p>Loving people often mentally seeks advice to the object of his senses, evaluates himself, his thoughts and acts as if his position. This causes the effect of the presence of a loved one, even if it is far away; focus on his assessment, outlook, perception. With a harmonious blend of reciprocity of feelings intensified over the years, with disharmonious - multiply misunderstandings. In such cases, people are trying in vain to explain the collapse of their illusions flimsy reasons, not realizing that the reason is the same: love, they spoke different languages ​​and could not adapt to each other. Knowing the nature of their feelings, it can be avoided.
</p><p>Complete harmony, as well as complete happiness - are extremely rare, but the path to it, though not easy, is only through the knowledge of the characteristics of each other. And still - through a desire to turn his attraction to a person in true love. And for this it is necessary to understand the nature of love and the different forms of its manifestation.
</p><p>Not all relations can be called love, but the species can occur in any situation, whether it is friendship or partnership, a passing acquaintance or a long-standing desire.
</p><p>For example, people who are inclined more to the sensual love, have at its core the type of relationship - eros. This means that testing is not attracted to each partner, people with this type of relationship over the spiritual and intellectual proximity appreciate specific sensations, carrying them joy in communicating with partners: delicious food, touch, gifts, entertainment and other joint earthly pleasures. Vividly their hedonism manifested in love; less pronounced in friendly and business relations. In the case of aversion to the partner, a person with this form of the senses produces the sharpest criticism often on aspects related to feelings.
</p><p>The forms of love are associated with certain features of character, on the basis of which was created by the author's typology of accents of the characters with their corresponding forms of feelings and relationships (character accents - complexes of certain character traits associated with the projection of the elements of information exchange, manifested in the psycho-physical level of personality).
</p><p>To determine the nature of their accents, and then - the form of feelings and relationships, we proceed to testing, which will be simple and concise.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Test_for_Accentuations_of_Personality">Test for Accentuations of Personality</span></h2>
<p>The test consists of an 8-scales with a set of relevant statements. Each of these scales has its own drive letter and corresponds to a particular accent character. To determine what the nature of accents you most pronounced, read all of the text, noting in each scale number of statements with which you agree, estimating the number of replies to the pros, the relevant degree of your confidence in the correctness of the chosen statement:
</p><p>(+) - Yes, it happens quite often (most likely agree); <br />
(++) - Yes, it happens almost always (agree); <br />
(+++) - Yes, it happens always (totally agree). <br />
</p><p>Compare the results. In what scale advantages will be more - this is the main focus will be your character. Write down the letter abbreviation of the scale, which is best for you. Choose from the remaining 7-scales and the one that more than any other reflects your features and also make a note of its number.
</p><p>Look, what of the remaining scales you could put on the third place. Write her a letter. Perhaps this is not found, then you have only two accent character. First, you select the main focus will be the following - optional. Read their names that match the letters you have chosen the Latin scales and discover the characteristics suggested below.
</p><p>Note: If the predominantly positive statements you have selected two test scale and accents your chosen correspond to the two leading features of your type - congratulations: you are quite whole person, and you have little internal contradictions. If you select two or more scales and do not know which one to prefer, try to determine their main focus character by choosing the most suitable characteristics (of the alleged resulting from testing). Read the descriptions of his alleged type accent and make his self-portrait, consisting of two or three combinations of your type accents. If one or two of the chosen accents do not match any of your two leading personality type functions - perhaps in this lies the source of many of your problems and you need to do psycho-correction.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Characteristics_of_Forms_of_Love">Characteristics of Forms of Love</span></h2>
<p>1. <b>Storge</b> - this is love-tenderness, that includes deep understanding and compassion. The ability to compromise, kindness, and ability to smooth out the contradictions are all inherent to such feeling. This form of relations is characterized by: solidarity with a partner in everything, leniency towards their shortcomings, pursuit of a harmonious, stable, pleasant, and laid-back attitude. This is an ideal form of love for family life, provided that the partner will show some sensitivity. Excessive vulnerability of this feeling does not make it resilient in all cases. The attraction of the soul is of main significance here, prevailing over physical attraction. Storge originated in antiquity, developed further during the Renaissance, and in our time has not lost its relevance.
</p><p>2. <b>Mania</b> - prolonged emotional ecstasy, obsession with love, over-valuation of its significance, which leads to strong emotional shocks, reckless actions, and even dramas. This feeling is strong, possessive, demanding, thirsty for complete reciprocity, but also capable of many compromises. This love is very enduring, even in those cases when it is unrequited. Often it is capable of heroism and sacrifice, and even unconditional devotion. It is full of contradictions, since it is very dependent on changeable moods. Quarrels may be frequent with this kind of love, as well as sharp contrasts in behavior, even fleeting infidelity. It is the cause for unpredictable actions and disregard for generally accepted norms of behavior. Mania love exists since ancient times, but it became most widespread in the 20th century in Western Europe after the sexual revolution, whose followers called for the emancipation of the senses and the denial of the cold bourgeois rationality. It has not lost its relevance in our pragmatic time, though it has become less dramatic.
</p><p>3. <b>Analita</b> - a form of love for which the wish for calm and rational relations is inherent. This love is individual-selective, with high demands towards the object of feelings, with a tendency to become disappointed in that person, if he or she did not meet some expectations. This demanding attitude is devoid of idealism, but often exceeds the real abilities of people. This feeling is intellectual, with a tendency to think and analyze the behavior of the partner, while not immersing in his inner world. It has an abstracting-generalizing nature, with tendencies to draw conclusions detached from the object of feelings; here, are a few emotions and sensations. Not marked by propensity to yield and make concessions. Aspiring to a reasonable and harmonious combination of intellectual needs and physical desires, the owner of Analita form of love requires many concessions from his or her partner. This form of love most clearly manifested in the 19th century and is well reflected in the philosophy of Freud, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, and others. In many, who do not meet their ideal partner, this form of love is transformed into its complete negation. In current times of progressing equality of genders (biarhata) it gradually loses its relevance and manifests less vividly, but it is still relevant. Since no name was given to it in literature, the author has proposed her own term.
</p><p>4. <b>Pragma</b> - sober, pragmatic, and sensible form of love according to a spiritual or material calculation. Despite certain ego-centrism, it is oriented at a fair balance between "giving" and "receiving". It presumes relating to the object of one's feelings with respect and with a wish to understand them. This form of love is natural and rational in the manifestation of its needs. It is characterized by an aspiration towards mutual satisfaction of desires and interests, although personal interests in it sometimes put above the interests of the partner. Habit strengthens it, and over time the object of feelings turns into a necessary possession, which is treated with much care. This form of love was described by Spinoza. It was most popular was in the 18th century, although it existed in all historical periods. It has not lost its popularity in our time. Unions that are associated with it are called marriages of convenience.
</p><p>5. <b>Agape</b> - this is sacrificial and idealistic form of love. It is based on tolerance at its foundation. This is a pretty stable feeling with elements of fatalism. Its owner is able to forgive much and take self-denial as granted. Refined and poetic, such love can exist for a long time at a distance from the object of feelings, even without hope for reciprocity. Within it lies the desire to protect one's illusion from any destructive actions from reality, thus in such relations there is a tendency for self-deception. Despite its complex and contradictory nature, it, more than other forms of love, predisposes to humility. Sometimes a person who has this form of love has to take radical decisions, for example, to part with a loved one out of their own initiative. But the image of a loved one, even after a long time of separation, can be observed loyalty. Spiritual desire here always prevails over the physical. This form of love-humility became more wide-spread with the emergence of Christianity, but it is still relevant in our time.
</p><p>6. <b>Filia</b> - this is a spiritual feeling, which is based on kinship of souls, interests, and motives at its foundation - a kind of intellectual communion. This feeling engenders friendship with sense of deep respect and understanding. It has a very selective character, uniting like-minded people and stimulating mutual development of capabilities. This is a love between equal partners, that does not tolerate coercion and, moreover, dictates in anything. People who are characterized by this form of love can remain loyal only to a chosen partner who does not disappoint them. They part without regrets with partners who did not meet their expectations, or who are alien to them in spirit and ways of thinking. They are much more tolerant of sexual disharmony. This form of love was developed in the Renaissance, but was glorified even before those times by Plato, and since then called platonic. Nowadays, it is becoming increasingly important for groups and societies too saturated by sexual permissiveness.
</p><p>7. <b>Eros</b> - this is a passionate, powerful, and sensual attraction to the object of love. Appearance and manner of behavior of a loved one are of great value here. They evoke aesthetic feelings and reverence before the outward perfection, often exaggerated - of face, figure, gait. People for whom this form of love is predominant seek harmony of both body and soul, and are able to turn a blind eye to minor flaws and faults. Inspired by love, they are capable of great devotion, constantly improving their own manners and ways of expressing their feelings, as well as forms of their body, beauty of their clothes, aesthetics of their environment. They willingly adjust and adapt their partner to themselves. They give much importance to physical enjoyments. Not finding the desired harmony, they become forever disappointed in the object of their feelings, and easily part ways with him or her. This form of displays of affection became widespread in ancient Greece, is most characteristic of developed societies, and is still widely promoted by the media and various forms of art.
</p><p>8. <b>Victoria</b> - this type of erotic behavior is the most distant from the intellectual and spiritual needs than others. It lacks in depth and creativity. It is based on a pleasant feeling of conquering the object of one's feelings. This is a kind of game-struggle. If the conquered person does not resist, interest towards him or her is quickly lost. For introverts or ambiverts (less sociable people) this feeling can be very stable and reliable, when a loved one is regarded as a necessary possession. Attention to the partner manifests as never-ending demands, which imply the best of intentions. This feeling can be quite ego-centric, sometimes distant from compassion. In extroverts (more outgoing people) this form of love often lacks consistency, since the pursuit of sexual diversity that gives a sense of the joy of new victories is inherent to it. The partner is often seen as an enemy or as a fortress, that is taken by storm. The partner is looked down upon, without mercy, and without any desire to achieve full mutual understanding. This form of love originated in ancient Greece. It was most popular during the times of slavery. Currently, in more developed and spiritual societies, it loses its popularity. In American culture, after the sexual revolution, the extroverted form of this love has gained popularity, and has not lost its relevance to the moment. In an archaic form, the introverted form of this type of love persists in societies that traditionally assign women a secondary role.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Compatibility_of_Forms_of_Love">Compatibility of Forms of Love</span></h2>
<p>Human life is rarely complete without love, but everyone loves in his own way. We need to understand the main thing - a person can not love as you want it. He likes the way he is by nature tend to. Your right to take his love for what it is, or reject it, if this form of expression of feelings you do not like. If you want to achieve harmony in the feelings with someone you love, understand what forms of relationship, each unconsciously expects from the other, and try to develop them in yourself. They say that a habit - this is second nature, so desirable over time, can become a reality. Consider the compatibility relations on a purely personal, emotional level.
</p><p><b>The most compatible combinations:</b>
</p>
<dl><dd> 1. Storge and Pragma. <br />
<dl><dd> The union of Peacemaker and Professional.
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> 2. Mania and Analita. <br />
<dl><dd> The union of Romantic and Logician.
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> 3. Agape and Victoria. <br />
<dl><dd> The union of Forecaster and Conqueror.
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> 4. Filia and Eros. <br />
<dl><dd> The union of Dreamer and Epicurean. 
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p>These opposite kinds of love are highly complementary. For example, a very strong union forms between people with forms of love Storge and Pragma, as with these feelings calm harmonious life that strengthens relations is very much valued. Mania can significantly move its bearer, who wants to meet the particularly high requirements of Analita personality, who, in turn, balances with sober rationality impulsive feelings of Mania. With the commanding proprietary Victoria only a sacrificial feeling Agape can get along, capable of obeying the will of another. As for the love form Eros, then only extensive capabilities and imagination of intellectual Filia can retain for a long time the interest of such a passionate and demanding partner. This is an excellent union of mind, body, and soul.
</p><p><b>Incompatible types of relationships include:</b>
</p>
<dl><dd> 1. Storge and Analita.<br />
<dl><dd> Gentle, vulnerable Storge cannot stand aloof and spiritless, strict and demanding Analita. For Analita Storge is too primitive, boring, and even saccharine. It is hard for them to find mutual understanding and harmony in feelings.
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> 2. Mania and Pragma.<br />
<dl><dd> The cult of the emotions is not compatible with practical calculation. Mania to Pragma seems restless and clingy, Pragma to Mania - cynical and boring.
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> 3. Agape and Eros.<br />
<dl><dd> Melancholic Agape does not evoke admiration and excitement in Eros. Eros wounds Agape by its high demands. In addition, the owner of Eros does not need sympathy, pity, and humility, but rather an equal partner, who evokes elation of feelings.
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> 4. Filia and Victoria.<br />
<dl><dd> It's the age-old conflict between the spiritual and the corporeal, between the desire for equality and subordination, between practical interests and their neglect. They are not attracted to each other.
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p><b>Combinations of types of relations with an average compatibility (which with some fine-tuning can get along):</b>
</p>
<dl><dd> 1. Storge and Victoria.<br />
<dl><dd> Tactful Storge goes for compromises for the sake of harmony and durability of relations. She is patient and with time softens Victoria. Its ability to be flexible at times brings it closer to Agape, that is necessary for Victoria.
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> 2. Mania and Eros.<br />
<dl><dd> The cult of love unites them and in the beginning makes their emotions bright. Over time, fatigue sets in from satiation with emotions, but Mania firmly holds onto Eros. Their relationship is usually turbulent, but interesting for both. However, the exact outcome here is not always predictable.
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> 3. Agape and Pragma.<br />
<dl><dd> Idealistic sacrificial attitude and sound calculation, despite some friction, converge on the mutual desire for stability and permanence.
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> 4. Filia and Analita.<br />
<dl><dd> This is a highly intellectual union in which both strive for perfection. However, for Filia there is not enough sensuality, and for Analita - emotionality in their relationship, but they find common interests that bring them together. They will part with each other only because of ideological differences or intimate dissatisfaction.
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p>Partner can't always adapt to each other with an average degree of compatibility, but if it happens, they manage to get along.
</p><p>There is another combination of forms of love with an average degree of compatibility, when the partners mutually cancel/extinguish each other's feelings. In such cases, there is either no convergence, or people quickly lose interest in each other and part. However, in some cases, people in such couples adapt to each other under the pressure of external factors: children, property issues, etc. But they strongly irritate each other, which is difficult to endure if there is no love.
</p><p><b>Extinguishing relations:</b>
</p>
<dl><dd> 1. Storge and Mania.<br />
<dl><dd> Tenderness and passion with shared focus on the cult of love at first makes them very attractive partners for each other. But soon it turns out that they understand love differently, and this is disappointing to both.
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> 2. Agape and Filia.<br />
<dl><dd> Sacrificial attitude and equality together in love are mutually exclusive. Problems in demonstrations of emotions and sexual initiatives can extinguish both of them. Their interests are spiritual, but different. They get bored with each other, although superficial friendship relations can be maintained for a long time.
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> 3. Analita and Pragma.<br />
<dl><dd> Due to shared sober approach to love they first become interested in each other, come together based on mutual respect, but it's rather cold for them with each other. The emotional side of love is not expressed in this union. In addition, Pragma does not seek to become the way Analita wants to see it. As a result, mutual disappointment arrives.
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> 4. Eros and Victoria.<br />
<dl><dd> In the beginning this union may be turbulent. But Eros, that strives for harmony in feelings and does not accept suppression of personality, becomes disappointed in Victoria, and she, in turn, does not try to keep him. They are both very independent and easily go separate ways.
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p>The problem of relations between people is complex and multifaceted. Of course, approaches, that are based on understanding of relations on emotional and sexual levels, do not completely solve the whole problem of relationships, but they open up the curtain for understanding of this aspect of relationships. For more complete understanding of problems of personal relationships, we propose to take another step into this innermost region.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Correspondence_of_Forms_of_Relations_and_Emotions">Correspondence of Forms of Relations and Emotions</span></h2>
<p>Exploring forms of relationships, we noticed that there was some relationship between them and the forms of emotion, described Russian psychologist BI Dodonov. Having established these relationships, we have a new classification of the forms of feelings and relationships If you want to learn how to understand the emotional state of another person to be able to bring him joy or achieve emotional harmony, you will be interested to know what emotions bring the largest and most significant satisfaction with the representatives of the various accents of nature with forms of relationships inherent in them.
</p><p>Typically, each person dominates the type of emotion that matches the leading accent character. This does not mean that emotions do not fall into the category of leading, do not deliver a man pleasure, or not tested at all. Just the most typical type of emotions a person experiences more and c greatest pleasure.
</p><p>Introduction to the classification of emotions will help you to understand why the other person, which is next to you, does not feel the same joy as you do on those or other external emotional stimuli. Do not accuse him of callousness or enthusiasm, or - even worse, indifference only because he differently arranged.

This is another way to compare your feelings and desires with the feelings of others and search for a compromise that satisfies both sides fullest. In other words - this is another step towards each other in the difficult and thorny path of understanding.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Ages_of_Love_in_Our_Lives">Ages of Love in Our Lives</span></h2>
<p>Types of relations that correspond to different age periods.
</p><p>1. Childhood . The prevailing level of physical development. Boosts introverted sensation reflecting proprietary feelings toward parents and relatives.
