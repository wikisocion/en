</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<p>When you see it, you can not understand what kind of man. Its vast inner world sometimes can not realize until the end, even he himself.
</p><p>The man - who is he in this life?.
</p><p>The existence of good and evil ... The constant struggle of people for their own interests.
</p><p>Where people love each other, where was their conscience ...
</p><p>Sometimes he is afraid of these thoughts, the inability to resolve these problems punches him in the heart. God, this cry from the heart, which no one can hear - it is his pain, his cross ...
</p><p>Have you tried to simultaneously take the soul that can not exist together, something that can never be reconciled? Have you tried with all my heart to love deadly feuding people and try to be the best friend to each of them? Have you tried always , even in small ways, to live only by the laws of conscience?
</p><p>Conscience can only say what is good and what is - evil.
</p><p>EII wants to live like that all my life - at the very maximum, that had a clear conscience, and the soul is light. And the unfading light will illuminate the road in the darkness of the lost people ...
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Nothing_is_too"> Nothing is too </span></h2>
<p>In EII innate gift of understanding people, for any "mask" he can now see the inside of man, his moral potential. But he does not divide people into "good" and "bad", as believed in the fact that even in the most immoral and cruel man can always find nuggets of goodness. He was also the strength to see subtle signs of improper motives in the most humane and altruistic actions (including their own - he is trying not to make a distinction between others and themselves).
</p><p>Often it seems to me that I just forks: I simultaneously love and hate the same thing.
</p><p>A world in which he lives EII - is a world of people. Everything else (material things, ideology, scientific theories, power) a second time, because they are made by people and serves the people. Corny? Hardly. Most people firmly believe that all that is done by people, is personally to each one. That's it!
</p><p>EII even on a desert island will remember that he is a part of humanity. His "I" always, implicitly or invisibly, more like "we."
</p><p>Do not make people that would not want to do unto you.
</p><p>He does not live on other people's commandments - they naturally grew out of his mind, he did not obey foreign laws, and the law of his own conscience.
</p><p>Conscience - a special state of the human soul. When they say that "the soul at peace" - means a clear conscience.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_world_is_ruled_by_love"> The world is ruled by love </span></h2>
<p>Initially, since childhood, EII expects humanity and love between people. And in his mind as he can remember, has always lived a strong and selfless love: to his mother, brother, friend, favorite teacher ... It is expressed not in words but sincere trust, execution of foreign desires obedience in all things, a hearty sympathy for the hardships loved one.
</p><p>EII would like to see all the people at least a little in love with each other in order to live in peace and harmony. In fact, he tries to be a case in point for all others. In all, even seemingly minor conflict, conflict of interest, he is trying to deeply understand his reasons for wanting to see the problem from every angle, trying to understand the motives and desires of the people.
</p><p>Another one of my feature, which is found in very few: it is the ability to listen to people, to understand their experiences and help them whenever possible. Maybe it's not very modest, but I can happily say that I like to communicate with adults and with children, and in doing so to me interesting. I do not know, so I turns either in a child, an adult (not outwardly, but inwardly), by itself without being reckless or stupid. I just have the impression that my whole inner world is divided into several parts or parties, which appear in dealing with certain people.
</p><p>He believes that the best way to resolve conflicts - is a compromise, which should go all parties without exception (because there is absolutely unjust people, then there is no absolutely right). And he went out to meet people, makes concessions readily apologize if anyone was offended by it (even not for that) - but all this is done not only to convince a man in his friendliness and location for him, but in order to teach him the same friendliness and willingness to counter compromise.
</p><p>What I myself like is that I can not be offended by someone much, I have no malice, anger, insincerity. I quickly forgive insults and remember them no more.
</p><p>And if his concessions go unnoticed, unappreciated or, even worse, will be interpreted as a sign of weakness on his part? In EII with his inexhaustible love is unshakeable limits of forgiveness. If he sees that all his attempts to fix the situation is inconclusive, that this person does not want to properly understand it, then it "fence off" from it by an impenetrable wall of polite reluctance to have any whatsoever with him and will not allow him close to you .
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="All_my_life_I_am..."> All my life I am... </span></h2>
<p>He's very attached to his family, to his friends. Quite closed; childhood running around in the yard prefers quiet games with kids or single homework. At school he could be intimidating noisy, aggressive antics peers, strict and picky teacher, test and exams.
</p><p>In an attempt to overcome this, he sometimes puts on a mask familiarity, feigned cheerfulness, powered to demonstrate its power and will. But the real problem he will be only when the mask will grow to it for life.
</p><p>In EII limited circle of trusted friends, with strangers the same people behave quite shy and very tactfully. For a while he gets accustomed to them, evaluates them ethically. If you then come to the conclusion that their beliefs are consistent with its system of moral values, and then takes them to a circle (he takes the initiative to converge infrequently), offers to meet them, is talkative and sociable, but if he does not see any such possibility, then silence removed from them, to the point that can get up and leave.
</p><p>I'll go very hard with people, but I think I can, like no other, boasting their friends.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_mystery_of_the_human_being_is_not_just_to_live.2C_but_how_to_live_for"> The mystery of the human being is not just to live, but how to live for </span></h2>
<p>This dreamy nature with a light, slightly sad look, and sometimes it goes so much into his inner world, which happens to be no distinction between their fantasies and reality.
</p><p>Sometimes I do not distinguish the real world from the world in which I live mentally. It happens from this is frightening. I have a minor imagination and now, standing on the balcony of the ninth floor, I can imagine that I'm on the beach, and step "to the sea."
</p><p>Serious, deep, thoughtful understanding people allows him to almost always see the possibilities of their moral improvement and the improvement of relations between them - though not immediately and completely, but a small change for the better brings him joy.
</p><p>At first he was a rosy picture of people, a few serious disappointment in them not giving way to them, but now in his dealings with people outside of cheerfulness will always slip reproach, and the older he becomes, the more it will be more visible.
</p><p>Any manifestation of human dishonesty (especially their own) are causing him great pain, he tries not to show it.
</p><p>Friends know me as a smiling, cheerful person, but no one knows what lies constant smile sometimes the pain I'm trying to drown.
</p><p>In humans appreciates loyalty, duty, and reliability. In a private conversation EII focuses not so much what they say, but as they say - the intonation, the sincerity expressed by feelings and so on. For example, a guilty person can not apologize to them - it will be enough that it is internally realized his guilt and have a desire to make amends for it.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="I_do_not_have_to_learn_to_live"> I do not have to learn to live </span></h2>
<p>Sometimes, once again, trying to reconcile the "irreconcilable differences", EII sees his behavior bias and inconsistency. It's a bit frustrating him because he gives logical key - develops it at home, studying the objective laws, trying to work out a principle. But in the end still does not give preference to logic, ethics and behavior. Moreover, persistent attempts to "artificially" plant itself this principle does not lead him to solve problems, but only to the clutter.
</p><p>Objective laws of the universe "distasteful" to him that they postulate as a necessary condition of life the existence of "the struggle of contradictions," that is what he is trying to eliminate from human relations, as well as, in his opinion, results in rudeness, cruelty and violence.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="A_bad_compromise_is_better_than_a_good_lawsuit"> A bad compromise is better than a good lawsuit </span></h2>
<p>But the use of violence in any form EII condemned in principle. He would like it to be fully and finally removed from the human relations. He understands that the force can make a person at some point to do what he wants, but you can not convince him to do so always. Therefore, from its arsenal of moral persuasion, education and re-education, he tries to avoid willful and categorical order, the pressure command.
</p><p>Almost always, the external force it perceives as a manifestation of evil. But since evil can not be overcome by evil, and the power can not be answered by force. Evil uses violence because it is intrinsically weak, and have good and without the use of force sufficient funds for his win - otherwise it would not be good. EII is not only "invented" the principle of "non-resistance to evil," but life tends to follow it in practice.
</p><p>Believes that not anything external to restrict the freedom of people. It takes only restraint, based on the principles of his own conscience and sense of duty. EII and he tries to avoid dependence (eg, financial).
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_work_is_not_out_of_fear_but_out_of_conscience"> The work is not out of fear but out of conscience </span></h2>
<p>EII in people very much respects the professionalism and competence. His own business capacity is not very large: it tries to be clever and executing the orders of competent people and believes that this is sufficient.
</p><p>Mind, so to speak, some of its "derivatives" I love, respect and admire.
</p><p>It's hard to believe, but EII like to read the instructions and follow them unquestioningly. Subconsciously, he is confident in the accuracy and reliability of any professional advice, written on paper. If he sees in them neglect or, worse, deliberate misinformation, it can hurt him deeply.
</p><p>He does not like to do several things at once, throw away is it better to do one thing, but with full dedication. Attentively and even happy to hear constructive comments on their work, clear guidance on a more convenient method of its implementation.
</p><p>Thanks to their diligence children of this type are generally well study, carried out on time all the tasks of teachers. Even on the field in the notebooks they assign exactly the recommended amount of teacher cells.
</p><p>EII can be difficult to bring order to their things in the room, but it is with great diligence support order established by others. Very economical, but of excess, unnecessary things is immediately freed.
</p><p>Not just get rid of them, but also feel relief from this.
</p><p>Their appearance EII tries not to stand out, its purpose - to make a good impression on others. Vulgarities or carelessness he regards as disrespectful to the people. But he himself is not very easy to take care of themselves, and there is a risk that it may gradually become a gray and insignificant in appearance. He gratefully accepted a friendly help a loved one in the matter of its own life and convenience: the main thing that it just was not a hint of arrogance protection.
</p><p>Sensitive to the health of loved ones, care about their well-being, ensure that they have the opportunity to rest and relax after a hard work.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_is_now_happening_to_me.2C_too.2C_is_part_of_the_Universe"> What is now happening to me, too, is part of the Universe </span></h2>
<p>EII externally calm and reserved, and few can imagine the emotional richness of his spiritual experiences - he simply believes in the "sovereignty" of the internal condition of any person and that no "voluntarist" means to deprive him of the right to the emotions which he developed at the moment. A man wants to be sad - then, a manifestation of the location to it will be sad with him, and if someone is gay - well, to share his joy, even if not of the EII for her cause.
</p><p>However, it is often even unconsciously showing interest in the mood and health of other people, their emotional state. And it is not interested in what they are trying to "a great mind" to show others, and what they feel actually - fatigue, frustration, resentment. He will not climb into the soul of a man or a deliberate attempt to cheer him joy and sympathy take him into his soul, imbued with his pain and calm, gentle words convince you that "it's not that bad" and that "everything must get better." If a person is really bad, it can be hard to convince to change at the time of operation, relax, throw your worries for a short time.
</p><p>Life more interesting for EII when it is filled with close contact with the people, yet he carefully makes sure not to waste their time this communication. Accusation such as "I am because you do not have time ..." - Very difficult to read EII, though outwardly he may not show it.
</p><p>In fact, he seems to stand guard over all these "catch" and "not to miss" in others. In a conversation with anyone gently (and sometimes quietly and to himself) ask him when and where he should now be the right time to remind him of his plans. EII - perfect "administrative assistant" and to the relatives of such routines, so they can have time to do everything on time (the people of this type usually have a good memory).
</p><p>Its great intuition may even help him to see the possible dangers in the way of other people, and then he will warn them in time. At the same time, trouble standing up to his full height before himself, can not stop to see (it's easy to overcome if it is to give yourself advice as if a stranger).
</p><p>What is conscience? Personally, for my conscience - my third "I". People can not see it or touch it. It lives deep in the soul. Perhaps, it pushes people to improve themselves, but it is only an adviser. Obey it or not - a private matter.
