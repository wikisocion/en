<p>"So does anybody have any idea about legalities, copyrights, and all that junk? What can and can't we copy/paste/translate into this site? Is this stuff an issue here?"
</p>
<dl><dd>No texts copied from English language sites other than Wikipedia, but machine translating articles from Russian is probably okay for now. (<a href="index.php@title=User%253AAdmin.html" title="User:Admin" class="mw-redirect">Admin</a> 23:20, 3 June 2007 (CDT))

<p>I am working on the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://psychology.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page">Psychology Wiki</a> and we are trying to encourage the free publication of psychology knowledge. I would like to recommend that you use one of the copyleft licences say GFDL so we can all share in the development of your field. The limited access to many journals, and particularly translations of important work from other countries is stifling the proper development of our science. I wish you well with your venture and hope to contribute from time to time<a href="http://www.wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=User:Lifeartist&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Lifeartist (page does not exist)">Lifeartist</a> 16:31, 10 June 2007 (CDT)
</p>
<dl><dd>If I'm not mistaken, all of this wiki is part of the public domain (I think that is GFDL?). We'd be happy to have your contributions and are developing some pages on general psychological topics that are of relevance to socionics (or vice versa).
</dd><dd>It would help to make it clearer as it has important implications for potential contributors. Generally publishing under GDFL obliges people who use the text to acknowledge the contributors, while making it freely available<a href="http://www.wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=User:77.100.28.37&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:77.100.28.37 (page does not exist)">77.100.28.37</a> 17:15, 10 June 2007 (CDT)

<dl><dd>"...<i>is stifling the proper development of our science</i>" -- are you referring to psychology or socionics? Just wondering. (<a href="index.php@title=User%253AAdmin.html" title="User:Admin" class="mw-redirect">Admin</a> 16:50, 10 June 2007 (CDT))
<dl><dd>I would think both - as socionics has taken a long time to even get on the radar within western academic psychology, and I am sure the cross fertilization in the fields of individual differences, social psychology, physiological psychology etc would be beneficial to both parties<a href="http://www.wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=User:77.100.28.37&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:77.100.28.37 (page does not exist)">77.100.28.37</a> 17:15, 10 June 2007 (CDT)

</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>We are definitely interested in cross fertilization. Some of modern personality psychology, such as the Big Five, is not that interesting to most of us, but physiological and especially neurological research in the area of individual differences <i>is</i>. Research in compatibility and social psychology and even purely theoretical fields such as <a href="index.php@title=Memetics.html" title="Memetics">memetics</a> (since it deals with the concept of information transfer) are also of interest. Leading Russian and Ukrainian socionists are also eager to establish greater contact with academic communities.

<p>I have added "<i>Content is available under the GNU FDL.</i>" at the bottom of each page. Is this sufficient to cover copyright issues? --<a href="index.php@title=User%253AAdmin.html" title="User:Admin" class="mw-redirect">Admin</a> 16:52, 21 July 2007 (BST)

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Technical_issues">Technical issues</span></h2>
<p>There are some issues I'd like to raise:
</p>
<ol><li> Article named after people: they should be as they are on Wikipedia (a bot could probably do this).
</li><li> Redirects - use them as much as possible. Many alternate names exist for socionics concepts, and it would allow us to change the wiki standard name instantly. Also, dichotomy poles ("intuitive" or "intuition") should all redirect to the appropriate page ("Sensing and intuition"). Again, a bot could do that.
</li></ol>

</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Translations">Translations</span></h2>
<p>Maybe when translations of articles and such from Russian to English are posted for our Wiki-library or whatever I think there should be some kind of tags put on them to rate the quality of the translation. At the very bottom being straight machine translation (sucks) and at the top being "finished" or fully translated and easy to comprehend, with a few degrees in between. That way we could maybe spread out the work of moving towards quality translations.
</p>
<dl><dd>Good idea. We could use the tags "Translation-1" through 5 and then make these five sections subsections of a "Translations" section. Go for it. (<a href="index.php@title=User%253AAdmin.html" title="User:Admin" class="mw-redirect">Admin</a> 11:12, 9 June 2007 (CDT))
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I have created "translation-poor," "translation-readable," and "translation-good" categories. (<a href="index.php@title=User%253AAdmin.html" title="User:Admin" class="mw-redirect">Admin</a> 12:03, 9 June 2007 (CDT))

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Site_structure">Site structure</span></h2>
<p>I see that this site is growing rapidly in terms of new categories of information, but the existing ones aren't getting filled in.  The descriptions by function position for each IM element are promising, as are attempts to better translate Socioscope descriptions, but there's more interest now in creating new, equally incomplete categories.  Also, what there is has little information on the source of the information, either in the article or in the discussion section.  So, people may be naturally reticent to change or add to it, as it's difficult to respond intelligently to the validity of what's there without knowing if it comes from sources or is just someone's observation. --<a href="index.php@title=User%253AJonathan.html" title="User:Jonathan">Jonathan</a> 11:57, 22 June 2007 (CDT)
</p>
<dl><dd> The descriptions of function position stem in large part from Rick's observations during the London meeting, so it's "someone's observation", but so would be any "sources" on that <a href="index.php@title=User%253AExpat.html" title="User:Expat">Expat</a> 12:00, 22 June 2007 (CDT)
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Well, that's okay for the "ongoing projects," because they aren't encyclopedic in nature. But the more encyclopedia-style articles do need more sources for sure. Machintruc has been busy building the structure, which is bare in a lot of places now, but he is going on a two-month vacation in a week, so we should be able to catch up and flesh everything out&#160;:-) (<a href="index.php@title=User%253AAdmin.html" title="User:Admin" class="mw-redirect">Admin</a> 12:05, 22 June 2007 (CDT))

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Issues_to_be_resolved"> Issues to be resolved </span></h2>
<ul><li> In which headings should all words begin with capital letters? Do multi-word category names need to be capitalized (e.g. "Organizations and Schools")?
</li><li> Terminology of "information aspects," "IM elements," and "functions." People have been using these and other varieties of the terms almost interchangeably, but this will inevitably cause confusion. Here is a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://socionist.blogspot.com/2006/12/functions-or-aspects.html">discussion of the problem</a>and a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://socionist.blogspot.com/2007/01/psyche-and-reality-augustas.html">way to resolve it</a>. The only potential problem is that people on the forums have gotten used to other names or simply use them all sloppily.
</li><li> So does anybody have any idea about legalities, copyrights, and all that junk? What can and can't we copy/paste/translate into this site? Is this stuff an issue here?
</li><li> Is there a way to create, or automatically create a "site map" so that it's possible to see and navigate to what's there?  One can find things by memory or doing a search, but that's about it.
</li><li> Is there a translator that works with the Russian site?  It seems that every translator is fooled by everything but the main page.  It would be interesting to be able to compare notes.
</li></ul>

<dl><dd>One of the ideas I've been thinking about is to have a section for each type where we would gather a bunch of stuff that is relevant to that type, but without much analysis (except for talk pages, maybe) to avoid distracting people. Sort of like a collage, with pictures, clips, self-exposés, testimonials, "life advice," etc. --<a href="index.php@title=User%253AAdmin.html" title="User:Admin" class="mw-redirect">Admin</a> 21:30, 17 July 2007 (BST)
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>sort of like "this is us and what we're about" page for each type? I like that idea, especially if it's allowed to be built by the types themselves. That in itself would be interresting to see, like which types make highly organized structured pages opposed to the ones who go at it half-ass or random. We could see the page full of half-finished stuff before they got distracted that the ENFps would make&#160;:P . I think in the end too it maybe could work as a tool to help people figure out their types (where am I at home?). The same thing could be done for quadras too. Anyways it's probably best to work on the fundimentals and all that junk before getting sidetracked off into the <i>cool</i> stuff. I can't wait though, it sounds like it'll be fun&#160;:) <a href="index.php@title=User%253ABionicgoat.html" title="User:Bionicgoat">Bionicgoat</a> 21:43, 17 July 2007 (BST)
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I agree, it'll be a fun project. Should we make a rule that only people who are sure they are that type can edit the page? Should we provide a list of suggestions for what sort of stuff to have on the page, or just let people begin and see how it evolves? (probably they'll be comparing their type's page with the others anyway, so that might be unnecessary). I really like the idea, but I am a little bit worried that people who have mistyped themselves will cause confusion. Maybe my fear is unfounded. I'm hoping there will be enough people of each type to "correct" misfits. Let's start on this once the type descriptions in their current form are basically finished. --<a href="index.php@title=User%253AAdmin.html" title="User:Admin" class="mw-redirect">Admin</a> 16:22, 21 July 2007 (BST)

</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd> Well I do think that this idea will demand a more energetic stance as to people who mistyped themselves, which will get complicated also due to the blurred cases. <a href="index.php@title=User%253AExpat.html" title="User:Expat">Expat</a> 16:38, 21 July 2007 (BST)

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd> I don't think that only people who are a specific type are qualified to make contributions to it.  People can also take into account observations about other people.  Also, the Discussion pages are very useful forums for what should go in and what shouldn't.  Naturally, people who are the type in question are a very important source.  Sometimes, though, a certain different kind of bias can occur, where the person ascribes a number of positive attributes (or individual traits) that aren't type-related to his/her own type. --<a href="index.php@title=User%253AJonathan.html" title="User:Jonathan">Jonathan</a> 17:59, 21 July 2007 (BST)

<p>One thing I do think would be helpful is for people to understand which pages or sections are supposed to focus more on "classical" Socionics, and which portions are more appropriate for mentioning speculative ideas, anecdotal connections, and other subjective insights, which are valuable but shouldn't be allowed to get confused with the "basic" stuff. --<a href="index.php@title=User%253AJonathan.html" title="User:Jonathan">Jonathan</a> 17:59, 21 July 2007 (BST)
</p>
<dl><dd> I see what you mean, but ultimately what is "classical" socionics will be decided by consensus, and we can incorporate new insights as we go along.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> One way of doing this project might be to have a category for each type (like <a href="http://www.wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Category:IEE_users&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Category:IEE users (page does not exist)">Category:IEE users</a>) and then use the category page. <a href="index.php@title=User%253AThehotelambush.html" title="User:Thehotelambush">Thehotelambush</a> 20:04, 21 July 2007 (BST)
