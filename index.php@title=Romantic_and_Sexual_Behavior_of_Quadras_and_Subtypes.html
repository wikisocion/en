</p><p><b>Description by V. Meged</b><br />
</p><p>Motto: "To reflect and enjoy"
</p><p>The <a href="index.php@title=Quadra.html" title="Quadra">Alpha Quadra</a> is characterized by a general, prevailing attitude to establish pleasant relationships without any problems, which may appear to have a "superficial" character. Mutual demands are satisfied through compromise. Grievances are quickly forgotten. They value having a sense of humor and responsiveness to erotic stimuli. Common interests that are shared in an atmosphere of light, positive emotional experiences helps to strengthen their relationships. In sexual relations, they value freedom and openness. Partners are attuned to seek perfection and intensity in their sexual experiences. They are characterized not so much by their responsiveness to verbal stimuli, but to touches and caresses. They are invigorated by fun, entertainment, and delicious food.
</p><p><b>Description by A. Boukalov</b><br />
</p><p>The sexual program of <a href="index.php@title=Quadra.html" title="Quadra">Alpha Quadra</a> is characterized by tender touches and caresses. In the dyad SEI-ILE, partners "love each other by their skin", as if dissolving in each other's embraces. The sensing types SEI and ESE enjoy being gently stroked on their skin. However, the ESE is much more emotional and passionate in his love manifestations, because he has to shake up and active his dual, the LII. The SEI, as an irrational type, shows more creativity and flexibility in comparison. Intuitive-logical types, LII and ILE, especially women, initially show less activity. Mirror relations between LII and ILE are characterized by a paucity of emotions and feelings, since both are logical and intuitive types. Mirror relations between ESE and SEI are accompanied by bright emotions and sensations, but there is often an accumulation of mutual subconscious dissatisfaction with each other. In general, mirror relations in marriage slowly "neuroticize" both partners. The ESE suffers more from this due to his rationality, while on irrational SEI this has a lesser effect.

<p><b>Types:</b> <a href="index.php@title=SLE.html" title="SLE" class="mw-redirect"><b>SLE</b></a> (ESTp), <a href="index.php@title=IEI.html" title="IEI" class="mw-redirect"><b>IEI</b></a> (INFp), <a href="index.php@title=EIE.html" title="EIE" class="mw-redirect"><b>EIE</b></a> (ENFj), <a href="index.php@title=LSI.html" title="LSI" class="mw-redirect"><b>LSI</b></a> (ISTj)
</p><p><b>Description by V. Meged</b><br />
</p><p>Motto: "To endure and conquer"
</p><p>Types of <a href="index.php@title=Quadra.html" title="Quadra">Beta quadra</a> are characterized by a desire to test the strength of their feelings. Feelings of mistrust give rise to their tendency for strong relationships with jealous and possessive sentiments. When there is a lack of trust - deep, strong, and often dramatic experiences contribute to frequent quarrels followed by successive reconciliations. Such volatile emotional states are full of contradictions. A balance is achieved through suppression and submission of partners. Their sexuality is characterized by a mood of seriousness and passion. Often, one partner will behave in the opposite way of what the other expects, resulting in contrasting behaviors and sudden, unexpected emotional effects. For types in this quadra, coercive and defensive behavioral tendencies are sexually stimulating.
</p><p><b>Description by A. Boukalov</b><br />
</p><p>In second <a href="index.php@title=Quadra.html" title="Quadra">Beta quadrant</a> the nature of sexual program is of a very different kind. Here, tender touches and strokes leave partners indifferent. Instead they strive for an intense effect on each other's skin, which manifests in strong embraces, when partners squeeze and press each other. Both sensing type, SLE and LSI, are very jealous: one thought of their partner's infidelity may poison their life. It is not a mere accident that William Shakespeare, an EIE, describes how Othello (LSI) squeezes Desdemona when he is trying to kill her. Let us consider a real example: a married couple, students, an LSI (husband) and an EIE (wife), live in communal housing. Since the wife is a sociable extravert, her husband is often jealous of her contacts with their neighbors. The scenes resemble those of Shakespeare: "Whom have you been with?" the LSI husband asks and puts his hands on his wife's neck. She screams out, and he releases her out of fright. As for the SLE, he/she can in the moments of intercourse give accurate and decisive commands to the IEI. Mirror relations between SLE and LSI are quite complicated: in order to adapt to the partner, the SLE needs to constantly control himself, to keep himself in check. This tires him out, but if he doesn't do this, he "neuroticizes" the LSI by his sensory leading function, which is absent in the EIE. From EIE the LSI expects expressive dramatic feelings and support for his/her sensory initiatives. Meanwhile, the partners may adopt the most unbelievable positions.
It is interesting to note that when types from different quadra meet, they view each other's behavioral peculiarities as unusual, which includes sexual behavior. Thus, a female ESI was quite amazed by attempts of a male IEI to squeeze her – she had to "teach him anew".

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Gamma_Quadrant">Gamma Quadrant</span></h3>
<p><b>Types:</b> <a href="index.php@title=SEE.html" title="SEE" class="mw-redirect"><b>SEE</b></a> (ESFp), <a href="index.php@title=ILI.html" title="ILI" class="mw-redirect"><b>ILI</b></a> (INTp), <a href="index.php@title=LIE.html" title="LIE" class="mw-redirect"><b>LIE</b></a> (ENTj), <a href="index.php@title=ESI.html" title="ESI" class="mw-redirect"><b>ESI</b></a> (ISFj)
</p><p><b>Description by  V. Meged</b><br />
</p><p>Motto: "To collaborate and acquire"
</p><p>The <a href="index.php@title=Quadra.html" title="Quadra">Gamma quadra's</a> awareness and understanding of financial issues is dictated by an attitude towards mutual, material benefit between partners. They find a special significance in acquiring gifts and assistance in resolving business matters. This creates a favorable atmosphere and is also one of their erotic stimuli. However, in a quadra that is generally inclined towards stable relationships, problems of mutual understanding, frequent doubts, contradictions, and instability of emotions gives rise to crises and unexpected turns. The inherent emotional endurance of this quadra, combined with their rationality and practicality, helps them to cope with these issues. Between partners, volatile sexual patterns are the norm - from complete spiritual and physical mergers to estrangement. They are excited by light acts of resistance in a variety of settings.
</p><p><b>Description by A. Boukalov</b><br />
</p><p>The sexual program of the third, <a href="index.php@title=Quadra.html" title="Quadra">Gamma quadra</a> is very dynamic and often characterized by acrobatic behaviors of the partners. In dual dyad SEE-ILI, the initiative is almost always in the hands of the SEE, who uses his sensory function to direct his ILI partner. The ILI submits even when he is simply decisively taken by the hand. One ILI said: "If I am taken by the hand and led, I would follow at once. I wouldn't resist it but submit to the partner's control." When it comes to the dual dyad ESI-LIE, here frequent change of positions, high intensity of feelings, and high number of intercourses within short periods of time (for example, a couple of days) with subsequent long periods of cool down, relaxation and restoration of forces, are all characteristic. If the SEE cools down after the intercourse very quickly, the ESI might need one-two hours of strokes and caresses by his partner. Mirror relations between ESI and SEE resemble the mirror relations between LSI and SLE: ESI is also quite jealous.
It is interesting in this regard to compare the intimate relations of SEI and SEE. These are called "contrary" relations, or relations of complete opposites. This may result in partner quickly growing cold towards each other, especially the introvert, as they completely extinguish each other in sensory and emotional sense. In "contrary" couples IEI-IEE and ILI-ILE such extinguishment effect is weaker and slower to take place, because their sensing functions reside in unconscious perception of both partners.

</p><p><b>Description by V. Meged</b><br />
</p><p>Motto: "To protect and help"
</p><p>The spirit of <a href="index.php@title=Quadra.html" title="Quadra">Delta quadra</a> is characterized by an aggravated reaction to mental and physical discomfort. Therefore, a desire for harmony in all aspects of life is of special importance to them. They are stimulated by the combination of a beautiful and comfortable environment, delicious food, sincerity, and trust. It is necessary for them to care for the mental and physical comfort of their partners, as well as having safety and security in their relationships. For them, deep feelings imply a full understanding of, sensitivity to, and consideration for their partner's problems. They value mutual assistance in all things. Without this kind of responsiveness, harmonious sex can be problematic. The slightest faux pas or misunderstanding in a relationship can have an oppressive effect on their sex lives.
</p><p><b>Description by A. Boukalov</b><br />
</p><p>Playful behavior, laughing, tender pinches of the partner, etc. are descriptive of the sexual program of the fourth, <a href="index.php@title=Quadra.html" title="Quadra">Delta quadra</a>. The LSE shows more energy, though less creativity, in order to "wind up" his shy dual EII, and therefore he holds back less compared to the SLI. The SLI reserves his energies instead but shows more creativity with his dual the IEE; for both of them the approach is alike a high form of art. Female IEEs are characterized by wriggling, coquettish, cat-like movements. This dyad is strongly affected by external stimuli: movies, writing, lyrics, pictures, literature.   
A weak spot of IEE is pity or sympathy: a partner can be successful by telling stories of his sufferings and misfortunes. In this situation, the IEE becomes gentle and tender, and feels an urgent need to provide some relief. Incidentally, another epithet for IEE is "Don Juan": he can successfully court a woman, but in the last moment evade physical closeness. In this, IEE's dual SLI and activator LSE take the initiative into their own hands.
